.OVER BLACK.

Clicking. Flashing lights.

Then loud electronic music.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A beautiful hand holds up a phone for a selfie.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

A wrinkled hand grabs a post for support.

Someone is PANTING HEAVILY.

She sets off running down an empty side street in West Hollywood.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The hand belongs to DELANEY GRAY, 23, a blonde stunner, slight Southern accent, sweet as cherry pie but something of a people pleaser. She snaps a selfie of a group of MODELS at a table in an upscale club. 

All the girls at the table crowd around the phone--except for one.

DELANEY
Eve, get in here!

The straggler is EVE PORTUGAL, 24, half-Asian, pretty but not a model, more of a cool observer--Joan Didion type.

EVE
I'm good.

DELANEY
Seriously, get in the picture!

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The RUNNING WOMAN is not seen directly. She rushes between buildings, stumbling over her steps. Her clothes are ragged.

An IV dangles out of her arm. She stops to try to yank the needle out, but then--

She looks back. From her POV, a gang of THUGS pursue her.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Eve smiles, pretends to slide in the back.

As Delaney lifts up the camera and snaps the photo, Eve slides right back out, unnoticed.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The Running Woman stumbles--

--Looks like she is going to HIT the ground

--The Gang is right on her heels

--But she catches herself. Keeps running.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The models laze around the table like ancient Romans.

A YOUNG MAN comes up to speak to them. One model, LISELLE, 22, flashes him a death stare, but Delaney offers a dazzling smile. A bouncer quickly ushers him away.

LISELLE
Have you checked her story? I bet she bailed on us tonight.

DELANEY
Mia is always late. I'm sure she'll be here.

LISELLE
I don't know if this is her scene anymore. Since she got signed.

Another model, HAYLEY, 21, leans in.

HAYLEY
Delaney, I hear you've been making moves trying to get signed by Decadence?

DELANEY
Isn't everyone? I mean, my friend knows a scout. He seemed really nice. But people have said things before.

LISELLE
They do already have your look covered with Mia. Wouldn't that be, like, redundant?

Delaney is lost for words, trying to stay nice.

She glances over to Eve. She is scribbling her thoughts down on a napkin, not really paying attention.

DELANEY
Remember the first time we came here, Eve?

EVE
(laughing)
You mean when you got us free bottle service?

DELANEY
It seemed like a big deal back then!

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The Running Woman hides in dark bushes by a building.

She hears the gang of Thugs stop, out of breath.

THUG #1
You see her?

THUG #2
Fuck, she's faster than she looks.

The men fan out to search for her.

She scans, looking for an escape route.

She spots the bright lights of a nightclub. The SAME NIGHTCLUB that Eve and her friends are in.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Eve gets up from the table.

EVE
I'm gonna get some air.

DELANEY
You want me to come with?

EVE
It's fine. Just need to breathe.

DELANEY
Okay. Come back quick.

Eve picks her way through the crowd.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The Running Woman spots her chance. She breaks out from the bushes, SPRINTING towards the nightclub.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Eve approaches the door. Maneuvers past some friendly guys.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The Running Woman is getting so close! Until she looks back--

And sees a THUG hot on her tail.

She stretches out her hand to the club--

But the Thug TACKLES her.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Right by the door, Eve hears a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.

Her face drops. She ducks outside to the patio.

EXT. NIGHTCLUB PATIO - NIGHT

Eve checks out the street: deserted, except for a few revelers in groups.

EVE
Hello?

Still nothing.

But off in the shadows down the street, she sees a CIGARETTE light up. A man in dark clothes smokes it. 

Eve squints to see it. But soon, it is gone.

Delaney arrives at the door.

DELANEY
All good out here?

EVE
I heard something. Like a woman screaming.

DELANEY
There are so many creepy men out here. If you're a woman, they'll just jump on you.

Despite her curiosity, Eve decides to drop it. She chuckles to look unbothered.

EVE
Us girls have to be careful in the dark.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The nightclub is seen from a distance. The Running Woman's muffled CRYING is silenced.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eve stares at her laptop. An empty word processor--title, "Chapter 4". A blinking cursor. She tries to think.

Pulls out her phone. Just a quick peek, right? 

Her thumb hovers over the TikTok icon--but she stops. Decides to resist at the last minute. Goes back to the computer.

She switches apps--from the novel to a blog post on a fashion site: The Pacific. The title reads "15 Best Looks from Milan, June 2019." It's half-written. She needs to get cracking.

She hears the front door open and close.

DELANEY (O.S.)
Eve? You home?

EVE
Yeah.

The door behind her bursts open--Delaney, after a night out.

DELANEY
Are you serious? What did you do today?

Eve still faces the laptop, away from the door.

EVE
The usual. Jogged, did some writing, read some more of that Rooney book--

DELANEY
Your birthday is almost over! You stayed at home all day?

Eve turns around.

EVE
It's really a normal day for me.

DELANEY
No! You do not turn 25 every day! We have to celebrate.

EVE
I have to finish this article tonight.

DELANEY
We have to do something.

EVE
I really can't.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Delaney pours two shots of tequila on the kitchen counter. It's a small, cheap apartment, but lovingly decorated.

DELANEY
To my best friend in the world! And a year where she doesn't work so hard.

EVE
(laughing)
Cheers to that.

They throw back the shot.

EVE (CONT'D)
Jesus.

DELANEY
This is my third tonight!

EVE
Working hard.

DELANEY
My casting today was crazy. It was with Maison Candide, and-- 

EVE
That's the boutique on Figueroa?

DELANEY
They started in Brooklyn. Anyways, there was a scout there! From Decadence!

EVE
A Decadence scout at a casting?

DELANEY
Isn't that crazy? I feel like they're really interested.

EVE
That would be huge. But they don't normally send scouts around like that, right?

DELANEY
I was talking about it with Yasmin afterwards. She said they've been scrambling for someone for their Dior campaign. Mia hasn't shown up in weeks.

EVE
I feel like you could pull off that look.

DELANEY
Absolutely. Mia's great, don't get me wrong--

EVE
But you have a certain sophisticated look, that she just lacks.

Delaney beams.

DELANEY
Fingers crossed, I guess.

EVE
I'm so happy for you.

Eve seems wistful. Delaney wants to return the love. 

DELANEY
Did your parents call?

Eve glares at this question.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
What? You never know.

Silence. Eve is feeling moody. Contemplative.

EVE
25. What do I have to show for it?

DELANEY
Oh my god, NO! You have accomplished so much. You are really selling yourself short.

EVE
No I haven't. Graduating college is not an accomplishment.

DELANEY
You're writing that book.

EVE
Do you remember Claudia Meeks? She rushed Delta Sig for a semester and then dropped?

DELANEY
I think so. She had really frizzy hair?

EVE
She had a short story published in the New Yorker. Really good reviews. She just posted about it today.

Delaney jumps up from her chair. Hugs Eve tightly.

DELANEY
Who cares about her! You are so smart. And so hot--

EVE
I'm not--

DELANEY
And you work so hard! It's your birthday! Please don't be sad.

Eve points to the clock on the oven: 12:05.

EVE
Not anymore.

Eve puts away the tequila.

EVE (CONT'D)
I really do have to finish this article.

DELANEY
Wait! I got you something.

Delaney grabs a small, gift-wrapped bag. Pulls out a new POLAROID camera.

EVE
Delaney, I love it!

DELANEY
To add to your picture wall.

EVE
This will be so cute at parties.

DELANEY
Let's take a selfie!

The girls pose. Eve awkwardly holds the Polaroid with one hand. But she pulls it off.

She pulls out the photo and shakes it.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
(singing)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture!

The two dance together.

INT. THE PACIFIC OFFICE - DAY

Eve sits at her desk in an airy, open office. Instead of working, she stares from a distance at MANDY, 26, fashionable but a try-hard. 

Mandy is chatting with/ass-kissing the editor, JOAN BURGESS, 47. Joan, a black woman, is tough, smart, effortlessly chic--the kind of person Eve worships.

Joan finishes up with Mandy. Starts walking towards Eve. Eve hurriedly goes back to her computer, pretends to be working as Joan approaches.

JOAN
Eve. Excellent eye picking out that cerulean chemise for your Milan post. An unorthodox pick.

Mandy watches it all unfold, analyzing every micro-expression.

EVE
Thanks. I went on a couple of Italian sites for research.

JOAN
Non-English language sources?

EVE
I did a semester in Florence when I was in college.

JOAN
Very useful in this business. Time to move on to Paris, though. Christian Meisel just finished up a shoot there for Atelier, we need some new content on it by Wednesday.

EVE
Got it.

JOAN
Thanks.

Joan turns to leave. Mandy gets ready to pounce again.

EVE
Have we done a story about Mia Fielder?

JOAN
She hasn't shown up to any shoots in a while. What's there to write?

EVE
It's just strange. She's a big name, could be a big story. And people love true crime stuff these days.

JOAN
We might push out something. But honestly, that's more of a tabloid angle. Not really our wheelhouse. We're not a stuffy New York magazine, but I try to leave those types of rumors to the fashion blogs.

Mandy snickers behind Joan's back.

EVE
Right. Of course.

JOAN
If something comes up I'll leave it to you. Since you're interested in the topic.

Eve nods. Joan flashes a routine smile and leaves.

Mandy sidles up to Eve's desk.

MANDY
What do you think happened to Mia?

EVE
I don't know, Mandy. People stop showing up for all kinds of reasons.

MANDY
(bitchy)
I guess you're going to find out, aren't you?

EVE
I'll do what I can.

MANDY
We don't have many investigative journalists around here. Maybe the Washington Post will come calling.

EVE
As far as I'm concerned, this is already my dream job.

Mandy touches her on the arm. Gives her the most condescending smile possible.

MANDY
Oh my god! Of course it is. It is.

The two girls exchange faux-friendly glares.

INT. BLOOD DRIVE - DAY

Eve reads a thick book while she gives blood. Squeezes a foam ball with her open hand.

A TV in the room blares the news, but Eve doesn't listen.

REPORTER (V.O.)
A harassment lawsuit brought by a former employee of Andre Keezer, fashion entrepreneur and founder of Atelier, was dismissed--

Eve's phone rings. She picks up her phone and tries to not disturb the large needle in her arm. 

DELANEY (V.O.)
Eve! I got SIGNED!! BY DECADENCE!!

EVE
That's amazing!

Eve just hears loud sounds of joy from the phone.

EVE (CONT'D)
I am so, so happy for you!

DELANEY (V.O.)
Come over right now!

EVE
Blood is literally gushing out of me.

DELANEY
COME OVER!!

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

Delaney sits in front of her mirror, doing her hair. Eve stands behind her.

The edges of Delaney's mirror are covered with taped-on cutouts from fashion magazines--her modeling heroes.

EVE
How are you feeling?

DELANEY
Butterflies! But I'm feeling confident.

EVE
Good. Your skin looks fantastic today.

DELANEY
Thank you. I slept for 10 hours last night.

EVE
Listen, I know it's your first shoot with them, but would it be too much trouble if I tagged along? I was thinking of doing a piece on you.

DELANEY
About me? Isn't that nepotism?

EVE
No, I was thinking of tracing an up-and-coming model. Putting the readers in her shoes. More of a long-form piece.

DELANEY
That could be fun.

EVE
It would give you exposure. And I could write something that isn't a listicle.

DELANEY
A piece in The Pacific would be really great publicity. 

She thinks about it. Brushes her hair some more.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
My first shoot with them, though? I can't really ask for anything. And I don't know if they're letting press in.

EVE
(disappointed)
Okay. I understand.

DELANEY
But there is a group shoot next week for Atelier! Maybe I could get you on that one.

EVE
That would be so helpful.

DELANEY
Plus you could meet some of the other girls too. I'm sure they would be good to interview.

EXT. STUDIO - DAY

A group of louche models (including Liselle and Hayley) stand around in costume, smoking. 

Eve sticks out comically. She doesn't smoke. Just fiddles around with her phone, trying to discreetly write down their gossip.

LISELLE
I think Scott wants to fuck me.

HAYLEY
He is so gross.

LISELLE
I don't know. He has nice arms. They're really veiny.

EVE
Is this a photographer?

The ladies do not take kindly to her interruption.

LISELLE
Sorry. We're still on the clock. Can't talk to any journalists.

HAYLEY
Delaney should be done soon, though.

Eve gets the message. She heads inside.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

Eve winds through a maze of photographers, crew members, designers, and makeup stylists. It's a massive shoot.

On center stage she finds Delaney. She poses in front of a huge screen, wind machine blowing her hair, two photographers capturing her from every angle, shouting orders at her.

PHOTOGRAPHER #1
That's it, Delaney! Give me that! 

PHOTOGRAPHER #2
Hold that look! Hold it!

A third photographer, though, stands off to the side. This is ALEX BUSTAMANTE, 29, Mexican-American, soulful, casually dressed, less manic than the others.

Alex lines up his MATTE-GREEN CAMERA. Then sets it down again.

This grabs the attention of the shoot director, LIPPINI, 40. 

LIPPINI
Alex. Alex.

Alex does not respond. Lippini raises his hand.

LIPPINI (CONT'D)
Hold! Everyone hold.

The photographers (and wind machine) stop. Delaney stares quizzically.

LIPPINI (CONT'D)
Alex, this isn't a fucking nature documentary. Quit waiting around and take some shots.

ALEX
(sulky)
Working on it.

LIPPINI
The fuck does that mean? 

DELANEY
Are you feeling okay?

ALEX
Fine.

LIPPINI
Let's go again, then. Do your job.

Delaney starts posing again. The other photographers resume.

Alex stands there, fuming. Finally he TOSSES his camera on the ground.

ALEX
Fuck this!

He storms away, off the set.

LIPPINI
The fuck are you doing!

DELANEY
Alex?

The entire set is astonished. Alex slams the door shut.

INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - DAY

Delaney peers at herself in the mirror. A STYLIST removes the makeup from her face. Eve stands behind her.

EVE
So you know him?

DELANEY
Not really. He mostly works with Decadence models. But everyone says he's really good.

EVE
A professional wouldn't do that.

DELANEY
He's under a lot of stress. From what I hear, he was pretty close with Mia. 

Delaney lowers her voice as Eve leans in.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
In fact, one of the girls said they were dating. All on the down-low, of course.

EVE
Really? Did he see her before she disappeared?

DELANEY
It's all just a rumor. But I guess you could ask him. If you can catch up to him.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

On the TV, a scene from "Baraka" showing baby chicks getting their beaks seared off in a factory.

Eve eats a salad at the dinner table. She doesn't watch the TV: she's absorbed in her phone.

She checks social media for Alejandro Bustamante. His Instagram is locked and his website is down. She looks through her emails to see a sent message--no reply.

Now she scrolls through Mia's Instagram. She is a blonde beauty, with a strong resemblance to Delaney.

Eve scrolls to the top of her Instagram--her last post. A caption reads "My presence is a present ;) PC @alexbusta". 

Eve thinks. Then gets up from the couch.

She just blithely opens the bathroom door--

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Interrupting Delaney in the middle of a vlog. 

EVE
Oh, I'm sorry.

Delaney just smiles. Not annoyed. A circular light is now set up in the bathroom for video shooting.

DELANEY
The girl that makes it all happen! My roommate, Eve!

She shows her to the camera. Eve, as usual, is cool.

EVE
Hello.

She exits.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Delaney strides out, having finished her vlog.

EVE
I should have knocked.

DELANEY
Please. We have a no-knock policy, remember?

EVE
Not if you're vlogging. 

DELANEY
Yeah. My agent is really pushing it. Says I need to pump up my social media. I'm posting five times a day at this point, and it's not enough.

EVE
It's coming at the right time. Your numbers are way up.

DELANEY
It's definitely working. Just exhausting. 

She flops down on the couch. Places a GREEN PHONE on her tummy.

EVE
Is that a new phone?

DELANEY
Yeah. Agency got it for me. Super high-res camera. Anyway, what's up?

EVE
Do you have a phone number for Alex? The photographer who stormed off the Atelier shoot?

DELANEY
No. I think I have his email.

EVE
He's not answering. And he's deleted his social media. Recently, too. Mia tagged him on her Instagram a few days before she went missing.

DELANEY
You think he deleted his social media after he left the shoot?

EVE
I think he knows something. Did the police ever come by and talk to any of the models at Decadence?

DELANEY
I really don't know. My agent said he talked to the cops a few weeks ago. But they haven't found anything.

EVE
I bet they didn't talk to Alex.

DELANEY
I don't even know if they were actually dating. Just something I heard through the grapevine.

EVE
I don't think he would act so strange unless he knew something.

DELANEY
Oh my god. Do you think he did it?

Eve is careful.

EVE
I don't want to jump to conclusions. I just have to talk to him.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
Eve reads a book while waiting.

A SECRETARY emerges from behind a counter.

SECRETARY
Mr. Lippini will see you now.

INT. LIPPINI'S OFFICE - DAY

Eve shakes hands with Lippini as she enters his modernist, art-filled office.

EVE
Thank you so much for meeting me.

LIPPINI
Certainly. Delaney is such a sweetheart, meeting you was a no-brainer.

He glides down behind his desk.

LIPPINI (CONT'D)
How can I help you?

EVE
I'd like to talk to a photographer who works at Atelier. Alejandro Bustamante.

Lippini's face darkens.

LIPPINI
Used to work here.

EVE
So he did quit? Based on Internet searches I wasn't sure--

LIPPINI
Quit! He stormed out during a shoot. Humiliated me. 

EVE
I'm sorry to hear that. He hasn't been responding to emails--

LIPPINI
As far as I'm concerned, Alex is dead to me. He skipped town.

EVE
He's not in L.A.?

LIPPINI
As far as I know, he's gone off the grid. Won't answer anyone's messages. Had a promising career that he just torched.

EVE
So no one has been able to contact him?

LIPPINI
What's your interest in him, anyway?

Eve lies confidently. 

EVE
He was supposed to do a photoshoot with Delaney, but he bailed last minute. I just want to help her out. She's so busy these days.

LIPPINI
You want some advice? Find her a different photographer. Alex Bustamante is nothing but trouble.

INT. CAFE - DAY
Eve is at her favorite coffeeshop, absolutely plugged in and typing furiously. Three empty cups litter her table.

On her screen, we see various searches related to Alex--"Alex Bustamante WhitePages", "Alex Bustamante portfolio."

She clicks on a link saying "Alejandro Bustamante--Phone, Address, Background info." The page shows his family: Jose Bustamante, Julia Bustamante, Fernando Bustamante. 

An address is shown blurred out. She clicks on a button saying, "View full report." The next page requests $10. Eve sighs. Pulls out her credit card.

EXT. L.A. STREET - DAY

Eve walks home. Her phone buzzes.

Her screen shows an email: "Your full background report." She opens the file.

Scrolls down--

Jackpot. An address in East L.A. for Julia Bustamante.

EXT. EAST L.A. HOUSE - DAY

Eve stands outside a small, working-class house in East L.A. Rings the doorbell. A dog barks. Children can be heard crying inside.

The door is answered by a cheerful Hispanic woman, MRS. JULIA BUSTAMANTE, 52. Her smile is wiped off her face by the sight of Eve.

EVE (CONT'D)
Are you Mrs. Julia Bustamante? 

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Who are you?

EVE
I'm Eve Portugal, with The Pacific magazine. Is Alejandro here? I'd like to--

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
No. You are with those people! He is not home!

She starts to close the door.

EVE
What people! Mrs. Bustamante, I'm with a magazine--

Mrs. Bustamante SLAMS the door.

EVE (CONT'D)
Wait! I'm a friend of Mia Fielder!

She waits. Until--

The door peeps open.

EVE (CONT'D)
I just want to know what happened to her.

Mrs. Bustamante still looks suspicious.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
You are not with those people?

EVE
I'm just a concerned friend. Seriously. I'm not with any group. I just need to talk to Alejandro.

Mrs. Bustamante finally relents.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
It's true, though. He isn't home.

INT. EAST L.A. HOUSE - DAY

Eve sits on their couch. The house is lively, packed with decor. Several dogs lounge around.

Mrs. Bustamante serves Eve tea.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
I never thought working for those people was a good idea. He was so bright. I always wanted him to go to medical school.

EVE
I've heard that story before.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
But he loved his camera. So he took a job at that place. I've seen their ads. Taking pictures of girls in bikinis, I didn't like it. I'm a churchgoing woman. But he said it was good for his career.

She settles into the couch alongside Eve.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE (CONT'D)
And he started seeing that girl. Mia. I met her one time. 

EVE
It was that serious?

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Alejandro is a good son. He wanted me to meet her. At first I didn't like her. She doesn't dress...well, not many clothes. But she seemed to care for him. Truly.

Eve is stunned at this.

EVE
They kept it secret from everyone.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Not from his mother. 

This pains Eve a little bit.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE (CONT'D)
Anyways, a week ago, he comes home looking like a ghost. Doesn't want to talk to me. Just packs his bags. And leaves the next day. Now he doesn't call. I don't even know where my son is! Can you imagine?

EVE
That's horrible. Do you still keep in contact with him?

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Alejandro sends us messages over this phone app. Something about security.

EVE
An encrypted messaging service?

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Yes, that's it. He fears for his life, I think. And people have come by the house, asking for him. You aren't the first.

EVE
Police?

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
No. The day after he left, a few men came here. They said they worked with him. Needed to give him something. But Alejandro told me not to talk to anybody. So I say nothing. 

EVE
Did that work?

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Three times since they have been here. Always asking for him. They are not like you. They look like hard men.

EVE
And he gave you no indication of why he left? Why he quit his job?

Mrs. Bustamante grows emotional.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
He didn't want me to know. Said it was safer like that. I just don't understand. He says he is okay, but it's like he is gone from my life. I did not raise him this way.

Eve really empathizes with her--she's been there.

EVE
I'm sure it has nothing to do with you.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Do you know why he left us like this? Did these people do something to him?

One of the dogs comes up to Eve. She pets it.

EVE
Could you put me in contact with Alejandro? I'd like to speak to him directly.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
He doesn't want to talk to anyone about that company. It will be hard for him to believe you aren't someone bad.

EVE
He has every right to be suspicious. But I can prove who I am. The story I'm writing could help him. Your son could be a major source. If I publish these allegations, shine a light on Atelier--he might be able to come home.

This wins Mrs. Bustamante over.

MRS. BUSTAMANTE
Okay. I talk to him.

Eve pulls a business card out of her purse.

EVE
I'll download whatever app I need to. Tell him to message me with this number.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The magazine staff members--Eve, Mandy, and a few others--are gathered around a table, with Joan at the head.

MANDY
The infographic compares the carbon footprint of different fibers--cotton, wool, synthetics like nylon. The piece discusses the pros and cons of each.

JOAN
I thought the tone was a bit strident.

MANDY
People feel strongly about the topic, right?

Eve's phone BUZZES on top of her lap. She pretends as if nothing happened.

JOAN
No need to lecture the readers. We want them to feel like they can help, not like they're bad people for buying clothes.

MANDY
Okay. I'll rewrite the piece.

Eve checks it discreetly. A message notification. A CHYRON appears:

ALEX: "My mother gave me your number. She said you're a journalist."

Eve's mouth drops as she reads it.

Joan notices.

JOAN
See an amusing meme?

Mandy smirks.

EVE
Yes. Very amusing.

Joan actually laughs at this.

JOAN
Let's wait till lunch. You can show us then.

Eve quickly types out a response before putting the phone away.

EVE: "10 minutes."

INT. THE PACIFIC BATHROOM - DAY

Eve rushes into a bathroom stall.

INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY

She sits right down and types out a message on the encrypted messaging app.

EVE: "Yes. Eve Portugal at The Pacific magazine. Saw you at Atelier photoshoot before you left. Want to discuss Mia Fielder disappearance."

She waits. Three dots appear.

ALEX: "Can't talk on Internet."

Come on!

EVE: "Secure line. I am not with police. Just friend wondering what you know."

ALEX: "They are looking for me. Not safe to discuss."

EVE: "Who?"

There is a long pause. Then--

ALEX: "Atelier."

Quite unexpected.

EVE: "Is that why you left?"

ALEX: "Yes."

EVE: "Can we meet in person?"

ALEX: "No."

Two women enter the bathroom, chatting. 

EVE: "Anything you can say over text?"

A very long pause. Finally--

ALEX: "It goes to the top. Andre Keezer knows."

Another beat, then--

ALEX: "Delete these messages. Will contact you later."

Eve stares at her phone.

EVE
(whispering)
Andre Keezer knows?

INT. THE PACIFIC OFFICE - DAY

Back at her desk. Eve browses her computer.

INSERT of her screen: Articles showing Andre Keezer. She clicks from one tab--"Despite controversial founder, Atelier soars to new heights"--to another--"Atelier chief Andre Keezer not apologizing for success"--to another--"Inside the stunning rise of Atelier, fashion's new kid on the block."

Her phone rings. It's Delaney.

EVE (CONT'D)
What's up?

EXT. CAFE - DAY

Delaney reclines at a chair outside a sunny cafe.

DELANEY
You know how the Atelier show is in two days?

INTERCUT - PHONE CONVERSATION

EVE
Of course. You know I'm going.

DELANEY
You're not just going. I got you backstage access too. Unfiltered contact with all the top models in the industry.

EVE
You are amazing. Seriously.

DELANEY
Your article better be amazing. You're getting prime, behind-the-scenes material.

EVE
I'll be there!

DELANEY
Awesome. I have a good feeling about this one. My agent has been talking it up. I don't want to hype it up too much--

EVE
You should. This is huge. This is the first step; Fashion Week comes next. Then Paris.

DELANEY
Guess I've been doing the right things.

Joan approaches Eve's desk.

EVE
Listen, I gotta go. See you tonight.

DELANEY
Love you!

END INTERCUT

Eve turns her full attention to Joan.

JOAN
Take a walk with me.

EXT. THE PACIFIC OFFICE - DAY

Joan and Eve stroll outside, under the bright LA sun.

JOAN
How's that Delaney Gray profile going? Her star is certainly rising.

EVE
Good. She got me backstage access to the Atelier show on Friday.

JOAN
Excellent. Excellent.

She pauses. Needs to deliver some tough love.

JOAN (CONT'D)
I support longform journalism. I want you to get a chance to shine. And it helps the magazine stay serious. But I need you to stay focused on your day-to-day work as well.

EVE
During the meeting--

JOAN
That's just a symptom. You've seemed distracted. Are you still writing that book?

EVE
Well...no. 

JOAN
Personal life alright?

EVE
Same as always. Honestly, it's this piece.

JOAN
What's the angle you're taking?

Eve struggles to decide if she should tell Joan everything. Decides against it.

EVE
It's tough. I want to have an original angle. I've been reading tons of past profiles so I can see how to be fresh.

JOAN
Don't worry about that. No one remembers old journalism. 

EVE
Right.

JOAN
You've shown talent, Eve. But you have to pair that with focus and dedication. 

EVE
(quietly)
I know.

JOAN
Let's try to get a first draft for your longform soon. Good luck at the show.

INT. FASHION SHOW- NIGHT

Eve sits in the crowd close to a runway. The fashion show is packed with photographers and adoring fans as models walk up and down. Loud music pounds; it very much resembles a club.

A leggy Indian model, PRIYANKA, 24, walks, to polite interest.

Now Delaney takes the runway. She walks with supreme confidence and poise. It's clear she's the star of the show.

The audience murmurs extra loud. Two REPORTERS next to Eve light up.

REPORTER #1
Another winner from her.

REPORTER #2
She's been everywhere tonight. Giuseppe's new favorite.

Delaney walks off to thunderous applause.

INT. FASHION SHOW BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Eve pushes through a crowd, flashing a press pass to security. She maneuvers past photographers, models, designers, security--until she finds Delaney sitting in front of a mirror. 

Delaney is chatting with Priyanka when she sees Eve approach. She jumps out of the seat and hugs Eve.

EVE
You were amazing!

DELANEY
Thank you, thank you! God, I can barely breathe!

EVE
Everyone was talking about you.

DELANEY
I'm being pulled in, like, ten different directions. I don't think I have time to talk right now.

EVE
Of course.

An ASSISTANT comes up to them.

ASSISTANT
Delaney, Tony needs to talk with you.

Delaney is flushed, distracted, restless.

DELANEY
Okay. Okay.

EVE
Go! Don't let me distract you!

Delaney can barely think.

DELANEY
Okay! We'll talk later.

Her eyes dart around--she spots Priyanka.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
You should talk to my friend Priyanka! An absolute icon.

Priyanka gazes at herself in the mirror as a STYLIST fixes her hair. Priyanka looks out of it--shell-shocked, almost.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
Priyanka?

PRIYANKA
Mia? Is that you?

Delaney laughs nervously. Eve detects something odd.

DELANEY
Pri, I want you to meet my friend Eve. She's writing a story for The Pacific.

PRIYANKA
Really?

EVE
Nice to meet you.

ASSISTANT
Now, Delaney.

DELANEY
You two are going to hit it off. Talk to you later.

She gives Eve a perfunctory hug before she is escorted away by the assistant.

Eve regards Priyanka, who reaches for her phone like a 3-pack-a-day smoker reaching for a cigarette.

EVE
I'm a fan of your work. You were posing with such confidence earlier. And over such a long period.

PRIYANKA
Thanks.

EVE
You're with Decadence too, right? Delaney has mentioned you before, said you met through the agency.

PRIYANKA
No, no...Decadence. I don't.

EVE 
You're with another agency?

Priyanka pulls up the camera on her phone.

PRIYANKA
Take a photo with me?

EVE
It's okay. I want to keep the focus on you.

PRIYANKA
On me?

EVE
Of course! I want to hear from you. The raw, unfiltered truth.

PRIYANKA
You're so nice.

EVE
I did think Delaney said you met through Decadence. Does someone else rep you?

PRIYANKA
I do...Atelier.

EVE
Atelier? They're not an agency. You do work on the side for them?

Priyanka suddenly looks alarmed. Leans in close to Eve.

PRIYANKA
Don't tell anyone. You can't.

EVE
Tell what?

Priyanka glances around at the crew milling around.

PRIYANKA
So many people here.

EVE
Do you want to speak privately?

A SECURITY GUARD quickly steps in.

SECURITY GUARD
You're needed.

The energy drains out of Priyanka. She's back to her dazed state.

PRIYANKA
Okay.

She gets up from the chair and hugs Eve.

PRIYANKA (CONT'D)
Bye.

Priyanka slips something into Eve's hand during the hug.

The Security Guard grabs Priyanka and directs her away. Just like that, Eve is alone in the crowd. 

Eve opens her palm--to see an OLD KEY in her hand.

She thinks for a moment--before deciding to trail Priyanka at a distance.

Priyanka is ushered through a nondescript door, before two bouncers post up in front of it.

Eve considers her options. She spots a black baseball cap on a nearby table. She ties her hair up in a loose ponytail, stuffs her press pass in her pocket, then puts on the ball cap.

She approaches the bouncers with confidence.

BOUNCER
Can I help you, miss?

EVE
I'm Delaney Gray's assistant. Need to speak with her.

She basically strides right past them--and they let her enter.

INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Eve pads through the hallway, past a bunch of identical doors. She listens carefully.

One door is ajar. She hears loud laughter. This is the one.

INT. BACKSTAGE ROOM - NIGHT

The room is musty, lit by dim, bare light-bulbs. Eve comes in cautiously, but no one notices her.

Everyone is fixated on a large table in the middle of the room, where a high-stakes poker game is ongoing. 

The players are all men--movers and shakers in the fashion world. Models mill about, as do less glamorous waitstaff.

Holding court in the middle of it all is ANDRE KEEZER, 55, larger than life in every way. He's husky, tall, and rough around the edges--the loudest person in every room he's in.

KEEZER
Cunt. Powerful word. It's the only word with any sort of bite left. That's the beauty of it. You say fuck, shit, damn, whatever, it's filler. But cunt makes people stand up, pay attention.

TONY RIVERO, 40, overly manicured, throws down his cards in exasperation.

RIVERO
Are you going to bet, Andre?

Keezer keeps working the room.

KEEZER
If a man can't say cunt, he's a pussy.

RIVERO
Any day now.

KEEZER
What's that?

RIVERO
You gonna bet?

KEEZER
Hey Tony, how's your dog?

RIVERO
What dog?

KEEZER
The one you're fucking.

Keezer chuckles at himself. The room--full of sycophants and ass-kissers--nervously laugh too. Rivero just takes it--he has to.

RIVERO
Good one. Still waiting, though.

KEEZER
Well hold on, Tony. I find myself undecided. 

He puts his cards down and barks toward the corner of the room.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Sweetheart! What do you think?

Out of the corner slinks Delaney, radiant, still in costume.

Eve watches Delaney approach Keezer's shoulder. He shows her his cards. His look is hungry, predatory.

RIVERO
You can't let her bet for you.

KEEZER
This is her night. She can do whatever she wants.

He grasps her roughly by the shoulder--he is far bulkier than the slender model.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Come on. What will it be?

Delaney smiles. Puts both her hands on a huge pile of chips and pushes them--slowly--towards the middle.

The crowd whistles.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
The best ones are willing to risk it all.

RIVERO
With your money.

KEEZER
That's what the game is about. Always has been.

He stares down Rivero. Rivero knows he shouldn't try to win.

He throws his cards in the middle. Fold.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
There it is! Son of a bitch!

RIVERO
Well-played, Andre.

KEEZER
It was all her.

He kisses Delaney's hand like he's marking his territory. 

Delaney glances away meekly--and makes eye contact with Eve, still in the corner of the room. Delaney stalks off, avoiding Eve's gaze.

Keezer continues to yammer in the background.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
These kind of games bring me back to Jersey. Used to play every night after my shift at the restaurant was over. Room just like this one.

Eve ducks out as well.

INT. EVE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Morning now. Eve browses her computer, dressed in a baggy old "Stanford Daily" T-shirt.

INSERT of her screen: a profile of model headshots. She clicks on a photo of Priyanka. Her agency is listed as "Paradigm Modeling." Eve frowns: what was Priyanka talking about?

She hears the front door open, then close.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Eve finds Delaney already slumped on the couch, face down.

EVE
You were wonderful.

DELANEY
Thank you.

EVE
That was a real triumph. Seriously. 

DELANEY
I've been waiting a long time for this.

Eve doesn't know how to broach the next topic. Until--

DELANEY (CONT'D)
I saw you at the poker game.

EVE
I'm worried about you.

Delaney finally lifts her head up from the pillow.

DELANEY
I don't get to walk those runways or appear on magazine covers if I don't do...this too. You have to schmooze. 

EVE
I know you do. We all have to. But Andre Keezer? With his reputation?

DELANEY
I don't trust Andre. I don't go into rooms alone with him. But these men...they get into this business to talk to us. To see us smile at them. To feel special. I give him a taste of that, and it doesn't cost me a thing. So why not?

EVE
Maybe you haven't gone into a room alone with him. But other girls have.

DELANEY
I know what I have to do. And I try to help out the other girls, I really do. But in the end, everyone really is looking out for themselves. I don't want to be the only fool who rushes out alone.

EVE
You're right.

She does not think Delaney is right.

EVE (CONT'D)
I don't want it to seem like I'm saying negative things just as you're seeing success--

DELANEY
I don't think you are. This modeling thing, it doesn't look pretty from the outside.

EVE
I know how this works.

DELANEY
Eve, when I was staying up, night after night, studying for organic chemistry, I thought about killing myself. All the time. You helped me through that.

EVE
I remember.

DELANEY
I don't want to go back to that. This isn't perfect, but I feel like--like a fish in the water. Natural. Like I'm doing what I should be doing.

EVE
You were great out there.

DELANEY
Thank you so much.

The tension is defused. Delaney starts fixing some coffee.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
Tony has me booked solid this week. New shoots every afternoon. This is my one day off.

EVE
Tony, the guy playing with Keezer? He's your agent?

DELANEY
Now you understand. 

EVE
Have you thought about a new agent? Someone at Decadence who isn't tied so closely to Atelier?

Delaney snorts at this.

DELANEY
Are you serious? Decadence is Atelier. The models, the influencers--we all have to answer to Keezer. He runs L.A.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eve sits at her desk. The computer is pulled up to her novel once again. But she types a message to Alex on her phone.

EVE: "Keezer runs Atelier, Decadence, Paradigm. Sent guys after you?"

She puts her phone down. Sits at the computer. Takes a deep breath and starts to type--

Until the phone buzzes. She checks it.

ALEX: "I told you not safe to discuss over Internet."

EVE: "Then let's meet in person. I'm worried about my friend."

ALEX: "She works for Atelier?"

EVE: "Keezer likes her."

Finally, the text she's been waiting for.

ALEX: "Okay. We can meet up."

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

Eve sits in traffic near downtown. Her hands grip the wheel firmly. She is lost in thought.

RADIO
Watch out today, Los Angeles. Those wildfires in the Santa Monica Mountains are only getting worse. Air quality is at 80 AQI, might be a good idea to pack an N95 mask handy and avoid heavy exertion outside.

She checks her GPS. It's routed to Olvera Street. 35 minutes away.

She taps the steering wheel.

EXT. OLVERA STREET - DAY

Eve wanders around the kitschy, colorful stalls of Olvera Street. The skyscrapers of downtown LA loom over her. In the stark sunshine, everything feels a little uncanny.

From behind one stall, a MAN watches her, unseen.

Eve checks her phone. She texts Alex.

Eve: Are you here?

AB: Yes.

She pauses.

AB: Were you followed?

Eve: No!

AB: Go into the shop with all the sombreros by the fountain.

Eve weaves through crowds, dodging shop-owners barking out in Spanish.

She spots the fountain. Goes into a store with tacky sombreros.

EXT. OLVERA STREET - PARKING LOT - DAY

TWO BLACK LUXURY SUVs stop across a park from the stalls. They stick out like a sore thumb among all the cheap cars.

INT. SOMBRERO STORE - DAY

Eve smiles at the store owner, who just nods. 

The store appears empty. She whips out the phone.

Suddenly Alex APPEARS from behind a stall. He walks straight towards Eve, GRABBING her arm.

ALEX
Come with me.

EVE
Jesus!

He drags her out of the shop.

EXT. OLVERA STREET - DAY

He keeps walking fast. Eve stops.

EVE (CONT'D)
Enough, Alex. Enough with the games.

Alex glares at her. He is unshaven now, dressed in all black (including a BLACK CAP) with a paranoid glint in his eyes. A far sight from the polished photographer she saw before.

ALEX
These aren't games. I'm taking a great risk by talking to you.

EVE
First you're coy on the phone, now this. I got deadlines to hit, okay? If you want me to help, speak straight with me.

Alex's eyes keep darting around the street nervously.

ALEX
I don't know if anyone would believe me if I did.

EVE
I've been with you this far. First off, tell me why I'm in danger by doing influencing. Am I in danger from Fabian?

ALEX
Yes. Of course.

EVE
What is he gonna do to me?

ALEX
What we did to all the girls. What I did.

EVE
What did you do?

ALEX
I'm a photographer. I took the pictures.

EVE
Of what?

Someone is WATCHING them.

ALEX
(guilty)
They were photoshoots.

EVE
Listen. I know you're scared. But I need specifics. Not riddles. I need specifics, emails, maybe pictures--

Alex spots something behind Eve.

ALEX
You didn't tell anyone you were coming here, right?

Alex SETS OFF into the crowd.

Eve tries to keep up, dodging passersby.

EVE
Please! Alex, talk to me!

ALEX
Someone followed you. They're here. They're everywhere.

EVE
It's broad daylight, nothing is going to happen to you.

Alex stops abruptly. Eve CRASHES right into him.

ALEX
You still don't understand, do you? You think Andre Keezer is just out there fooling around with girls, doing the casting couch? This shit is way worse than that. I'll be gone like Mia Fielder.

EVE
What happened to her?

ALEX
She got used up. Then they threw her out with the trash. 

EVE
Atelier killed her?

ALEX
Takes you a long fucking time to catch up.

EVE
Who did it? That doctor you told me about?

Alex spots a TALL MAN in the crowd behind Eve.

ALEX
Shit. Come on.

He grabs her arm. Steers her into the crowd.

He spots a BATHROOM. Head for the men's door.

EXT. OLVERA STREET BATHROOM - DAY

ALEX
Come on. Let's hide in here for a second.

He goes in before Eve can say a word. The door SLAMS behind him.

Eve tries to OPEN it--

But a bolt LOCKS the door right in front of her!

EVE
Alex. Alex!

She POUNDS on the door.

She looks around frantically, not sure if someone is behind her.

EVE (CONT'D)
Alex, open the door! 

Nothing. She hurries around the corner, searching for a window.

EVE (CONT'D)
Alex, are you in there?

Ominous silence. 

She comes back around, bangs on the bathroom door again--

And it SWINGS wide open.

INT. OLVERA STREET BATHROOM - DAY

The bathroom is completely empty. 

Eve sees only Alex's BLACK CAP on the ground.

EXT. OLVERA STREET BATHROOM - DAY

Eve rushes out. She scans the crowd--but there is no sign of Alex, or a struggle.

She pulls out her phone, calls him--

Straight to VOICEMAIL.

She sets off running.

INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

She starts the car, speeding off immediately.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

The sun sets over LA. Eve roars down the freeway.

EXT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eve calls again as she gets out of the car. Still nothing. She hurries up the stairs.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eve bursts into her apartment. To her surprise, Delaney is there with Liselle, Hayley, and Priyanka. They are all made up for a night out.

DELANEY
Hey.

LISELLE
Were you just running laps or something?

EVE
Delaney, has anyone been around the apartment today?

DELANEY
I don't know. We were at a shoot all day.

The other models smirk a bit at Eve's disheveled look. She motions to Delaney.

EVE
Can I talk to you for a second?

DELANEY
(slightly annoyed)
Okay.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

EVE
I'm worried. Very worried.

DELANEY
What's wrong?

EVE
Can you get rid of them, by the way? What are they doing here?

DELANEY
We're all going to go over to a party together. I heard the craziest news--

EVE
I just met a source who disappeared. I think I'm being followed.

DELANEY
What? By who?

EVE
The same people behind Mia's disappearance.

DELANEY
But that's the thing, Eve. She's not gone anymore. She's back.

EVE
(disbelieving)
What?

DELANEY
She's in L.A. working again. That's the party tonight. Andre Keezer is throwing a big thing at his mansion to celebrate her coming back. 

Eve leans against the mirror, trying to process it all.

A knock on the door.

LISELLE (O.S.)
Are you two done in there? We're gonna call the Uber soon.

EVE
Wait 5 minutes. I gotta get ready too.

Delaney is a little scandalized. 

DELANEY
This is a really exclusive party. I don't know if I can get you in.

EVE
You will. I have to go. 

INT. UBER - NIGHT

Delaney and Liselle chatter in the back of an SUV. Eve sits quietly next to Priyanka, who swipes endlessly through her phone.

Eve leans over to Priyanka.

EVE (CONT'D)
It's good to see you again, Priyanka.

Priyanka gives her a polite but confused look.

PRIYANKA
Yeah.

EVE
After we met at the show.

PRIYANKA
Right. Right.

She doesn't remember.

EVE
We should talk some time. I just got signed, and I'm curious about your representation and your relationship with your agent.

PRIYANKA
Okay.

The car slows as it approaches a gate.

DELANEY
I think we're here.

EXT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

The car pulls through a gate, past a security guard.

It stops in front of Keezer's hilltop mansion. It is massive and imposing, made entirely of concrete. The grounds are filled with fashionable guests milling around modern art sculptures.

The ladies exit the Uber in front of the mansion. Eve finds Delaney as they walk in.

EVE
I've heard stories about this place.

DELANEY
You're really in it now. The top of the world.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

Delaney is almost immediately swarmed by "friends" and hangers-on. Liselle and Priyanka scatter too, leaving Eve alone.

She approaches the drink table--where Fabian is also refilling on wine.

FABIAN
Ah, Miss Portugal. Such an unexpected surprise to see you here.

EVE
I can't return the compliment. You've probably been here many times.

FABIAN
I worked for Andre for several years. For a long time, Atelier employees would sleep here when they were visiting. He used this place as an impromptu office.

EVE
One way to build camaraderie.

FABIAN
Eventually the human resources people put a stop to it. Supposedly it gave the wrong image to the media. 

EVE
An undeserved one, I'm sure.

He gestures around the imposing house, with its low, depressing, cement ceilings and gloomy decor.

FABIAN
This place was built in the 1920s by an oil baron. The owner had it made entirely out of concrete, to withstand earthquakes, floods, and fires. He believed Los Angeles would sink into the sea one day, and thought this would be his ark.

EVE
Beautiful country burns again.

Eve checks out the doors--thick, with metal braces.

EVE (CONT'D)
The doors belong in a bunker.

FABIAN
Steel-reinforced. The windows have shutters on them as well. It would be very difficult to break in or out.

He lets that ominous pronouncement hang for a while.

EVE
Now, I've heard that Mia Fielder is in attendance here?

Fabian starts to walk through the party. Eve follows.

FABIAN
Ah yes. Such happy news when she returned. Many of us were worried. But she was just taking a break for mental health. Burnout can affect us all.

EVE
Is that what it was? So burned out she couldn't use her phone?

FABIAN
Maybe you should ask her.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - PARLOR - NIGHT

They enter a smaller room. Keezer holds court at the center, commanding attention as he usually does.

KEEZER
...so then Abdul says to the CIA director, "Give me that waterboard pussy!"

The room explodes in laughter, Delaney and Priyanka included.

Keezer has his arm wrapped around MIA FIELDER, 24, every bit the stunning model. But she is unusually demure, even cowed, in Keezer's overwhelming presence.

Keezer spots Fabian, with Eve close behind him.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Fabian! You son of a frog, is that wine?

FABIAN
I regret that I must be so stereotypical.

KEEZER
Makes the jokes easier.

He gives Eve a very unsubtle once-over with his eyes.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Hello. Who are you?

FABIAN
Eve Portugal. Newly signed by ---.

Eve does her very best to smile and seem appealing.

EVE
I've heard so much about you, Mr. Keezer.

KEEZER
Course you have. You don't do clothes, do you?

EVE
I'm in a more niche market.

She tries to get Mia involved now.

EVE (CONT'D)
And you must be Mia!

MIA
Hi.

EVE
So glad to see you back.

KEEZER
She gave us a bit of a scare, didn't you? Took that no-phone thing pretty seriously!

MIA
Yeah. I just needed to get away from it all.

DELANEY
Are you back to taking photos now?

MIA
Sure, let's do it.

Delaney motions for Eve to get in as well. Keezer glides out, squeezing Mia's shoulder as he leaves.

KEEZER
Don't think your followers want to see this old face on your story.

The room again erupts in disingenuous laughter.

Eve, Mia, and Delaney take a selfie together. Their pouting expressions are identical. The FLASH temporarily BLINDS Eve. 

She massages her forehead. The lights, the loud music, the talking--it all overwhelms her for a second.

EVE
(woozy)
I have to use the restroom. So nice to meet you, Mia.

As Eve stumbles off, Keezer swoops in again.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Eve searches for a bathroom, walking unsteadily.

The bathroom door opens. A wizened OLD MAN, no more than 5 feet tall, steps out, followed by a statuesque young MODEL wearing a West African tribal mask.

The Old Man giggles at Eve as they pass.

INT. KEEZER's MANSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Eve SPLASHES water on her face. Breathes heavily. 

She examines herself in the mirror. She checks her cheeks and eyes for possible wrinkles. Then she notices that the sink is full of her SHEDDED HAIR.

EVE (CONT'D)
Jesus.

She dunks her face under the water again.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

Eve wanders again, from room to room. The house is like a concrete maze. She spies various scenes of the rich and beautiful elites at play.

She enters one room and gets a view down a hallway. At the end of the hallway, a SLIDING GREEN COPPER DOOR is open, revealing a moldy wall behind it. A SECURITY GUARD leads Mia and another DAZED MODEL out of the room, followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER holding a camera.

Eve thinks fast and whips out her phone. She manages to surreptitiously snap a picture just before the door slides shut.

She heads for the door--

But is intercepted by DR. JERRY SPANDARIAN, 50. He's a gregarious Dr. Feelgood type: Beverly Hills' favorite plastic surgeon. He's gone under the knife a few times himself--and he wears an obvious HAIRPIECE.

SPANDARIAN
Eve, right? Delaney Gray's friend?

EVE
(annoyed)
Yes.

SPANDARIAN
I want you to know I've been following some of your content, and I think you got talent. I think I can help you get to the next level. 

EVE
I already have an agent.

SPANDARIAN
Fabian. We're close friends. Allow me to explain myself.

He navigates Eve away from the door, even as she strains to see more.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
I'm Dr. Jerry Spandarian. I have 3 million followers on TikTok, and a proven track record of getting top talent to look their best.

EVE
You're a fan of the hard sell, I see.

SPANDARIAN
I've watched some of your videos. I know you're a no-nonsense kind of girl. You have an intellectual bend that makes you unique. Stanford, right?

EVE
That's right.

SPANDARIAN
UCLA myself. Someone with your brains and the look I can give you would be unstoppable.

EVE
That's not really the market I'm going after.

SPANDARIAN
That's the market everyone is going after. It literally never hurts you to look better. I know you may have some preconceptions about the work I do--some people don't like it. The fact is, none of us are born looking perfect. But you can make yourself perfect. That's where I come in.

Spandarian spots a handsome young guy with a classic Gen Z perm haircut, CHASE, 21. He directs Eve towards him.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
See, Chase here was already born a stunner. But I helped him out with his chin, did some work on the nose, and now look at him? 5 million followers. 

EVE
He's a real Adonis.

Chase notices them talking, and gives Eve a flirty look. Eve smiles politely--which he interprets as a sign to come over.

CHASE
How's it going?

SPANDARIAN
Great, Chase. How are you feeling?

CHASE
Never better, Dr. Jer. 

SPANDARIAN
Hit 300 on those squats yet?

CHASE
Real close. I was just in Tulum and my workout schedule was all screwed up for a minute.

SPANDARIAN
This is Eve Portugal, by the way. A real rising star.

EVE
Nice to meet you.

CHASE
Chase. You've probably seen my content.

EVE
Pretty sure.

CHASE
What's your handle, by the way?

EVE
@EveAteTheApple.

Chase pulls out his phone and starts typing.

CHASE
That's a funny one. Like the Bible, right?

EVE
(sarcastic)
I think it was a Disney movie.

As Chase keeps typing, Spandarian hands Eve a business card.

SPANDARIAN
I'll leave you two alone. But please, come by some time. I'd love to discuss some future work. Make some connections.

Eve considers this.

EVE
You're friends with Fabian, you said?

SPANDARIAN
We go way back. I love that guy.

EVE
I might take you up on that.

SPANDARIAN
Glad to hear it.

He slaps her enthusiastically on the back and heads out. Now Eve is alone with Chase.

EVE
How crazy is it that Mia came back?

CHASE
I was never in doubt. Love that bitch--but she can just does her own thing sometimes.

EVE
She's done this before?

CHASE
No, but people just dip out all the time. I might do that soon, I'm so tired.

Eve is interested now.

EVE
So people you know just go missing for weeks at a time?

CHASE
I guess. You want to get a drink?

INT. PRIVATE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Fabian, Delaney, and Liselle enter an empty bedroom. Fabian shows them a large painting on the wall.

FABIAN
This was recovered after the war. The Nazis stole it from their original owners. Now it hangs here.

The girls weakly feign interest.

DELANEY
It's pretty cool, I guess.

Liselle takes a selfie in front of it, then starts typing into her phone.

LISELLE
Who did you say made this?

FABIAN
Delescluze.

LISELLE
Yeah, not spelling that.

The sound of a TOILET flushing. The door to the bathroom opens to reveal Keezer.

KEEZER
Come to wipe my ass, Fabian?

The girls look awkward, but Fabian doesn't exactly seem surprised to see him.

FABIAN
I was just showing them this exquisite painting.

KEEZER
Yeah, that's a good one. 

DELANEY
This is such a great party.

KEEZER
Glad you like it, sweetheart.

LISELLE
Sorry to bother you.

They turn to go--but Keezer grabs Delaney's arm.

KEEZER
Just a minute. Need to talk to you.

Delaney smiles nervously. Fabian and Liselle walk out--leaving her alone in the room with Keezer.

Once alone, he leans in close to her.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
I just want you to know. Just because Mia is back, doesn't mean you won't stop getting work.

Delaney shrinks from him, trying to conceal her growing unease.

DELANEY
I'm glad to hear it.

KEEZER
Tell you the truth, she really fucked up by taking off like that. I like reliable girls. Girls who don't make trouble.

He slides by the door, blocking it with his huge frame, even as he wraps his arm around her.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Tell you the truth, I like you better than her. 

Delaney is silent.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Do you like me?

DELANEY
(small)
Yeah.

Keezer leers.

KEEZER
Good.

He closes the door.

DELANEY
Wait!

She moves towards the door, but Keezer restrains her.

KEEZER
Come on. You're at Andre Keezer University now, and I decide if you graduate or not.

He paws at her like he's unwrapping a present. She is silent. Resigned. Helpless.

EXT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

Eve has been talking to Chase for a while now. He is actually funnier than she thought--or maybe she is just drunk.

CHASE
You cannot be serious.

EVE
I was bare-ass naked, in the library. Thank God there are no pictures.

CHASE
How many naked people are we talking here?

EVE
At least 50. This happens every year.

Eve spots Delaney, striding quickly out of the party.

EVE (CONT'D)
Oh, there's Delaney. Sorry, I have to talk to my friend?

CHASE
Delaney is your friend?

Eve catches up to Delaney.

EVE
There is something really fishy going on at this party. I saw some people going in and out of this room--

DELANEY
I just want to go home.

EVE
Are you okay?

DELANEY
I'm so tired. I just really need to sleep.

EVE
I feel like people here know what is going on. And I really need to find Mia, if she's still here.

DELANEY
I haven't seen her. Listen, you can stay if you want. But I'm going home.

EVE
No, I'll go home with you.

DELANEY
I don't want to spoil your night. You seemed to really like that guy over there.

EVE
Delaney, I'm just trying to talk to people. I'm doing my job.

DELANEY
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna call an Uber.

EVE
I'll come with you.

INT. UBER - NIGHT

The two girls sit far apart, not talking. Delaney looks miserable. Eve opens the window for some air, still blinking and woozy.

Delaney cranes up her phone and takes a selfie. For a moment she looks happy and stunning in the picture--but just as quickly she returns to her misery once the camera is off.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eve gulps down a green smoothie. She scrolls her phone: Mia posted a picture of the two of them. The caption: "Back on the grid."

The bathroom door opens. Delaney stalks out, her hair in a towel. Eve gets up from the table.

EVE (CONT'D)
This thing with Mia just doesn't make sense.

She stops abruptly. She sees Delaney's face--without makeup. Delaney looks terrible--wrinkles, eye bags, blotchy skin.

DELANEY
What?

EVE
I mean--you look really tired. You should get some sleep.

DELANEY
(grouchy)
I already said that.

Delaney stalks to her room.

EVE
I'm worried about you.

DELANEY
You're always worried now.

EVE
You look like you need a vacation. Your job is just wearing down on you.

DELANEY
No. I think I need a new place. I can't relax in this shithole.

EVE
I guess that's fair. This place isn't the best.

DELANEY
I'm not a starving model anymore. I can do so, so much better.

EVE
You want your own place?

DELANEY
You're doing fine too, Eve. You got invited to this party, right?

EVE
Did something happen tonight? Do you want to tell me anything?

Delaney averts her eyes.

DELANEY
It's just another party. Welcome to my life.

EXT. SPANDARIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Eve pulls up to a generic LA strip mall, right outside a modest storefront with a sign: "GERALD SPANDARIAN, M.D."

INT. SPANDARIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

.SERIES OF SHOTS.

-Eve's face in profile. A NURSE snaps photos on a phone.

-Then her face straight on. More pictures.

-Spandarian watches as Eve's entire face is detailed.

-Spandarian touches her face with gloved hands, examining it.

SPANDARIAN
Well Eve, I think you already know you're a gorgeous girl. But is there anything in particular you want to improve?

Eve lays on the bimbo vibe thickly.

EVE
Well, Doctor, Mia Fielder is my hero. I just want to look the way she looks. Whatever she got, I want.

SPANDARIAN
Well, she is a star. A lot of girls come in, want to look like her. I will say you have a different look than her because of your, eh, ethnicity.

EVE
You think I should dye my hair?

SPANDARIAN
That goes without saying. But I think the nose would be the best place to start. Yours is rounder than hers, smaller. You are of Asian descent, are you not?

EVE
My mom.

SPANDARIAN
My wife is actually Vietnamese. Anyways, your nose is typical for Asian women, but a simple rhinoplasty will make your nose approximate Mia Fielder's. After that, we could try an eyelid surgery.

EVE
That would be great. Is there anything else you did for Mia? Anything that is less common, less basic?

Spandarian laughs at this.

SPANDARIAN
Just because a procedure is common, doesn't mean it's basic! Now, for Mia and other top clients, I do have certain special consultations. Those are recommendation-only. 

Spandarian's phone buzzes. He checks it and grows serious.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
Speak of the devil, but there is actually an emergency right now with one of those top clients. I'm afraid we'll have to continue our conversation at a later date.

Eve spies the message ID on his phone--"Gaveau."

EVE
Is Delaney one of your top clients?

Spandarian can't conceal his surprise--the answer is yes, but he can't say it.

SPANDARIAN
Doctor-patient confidentiality. So nice to meet you.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Spandarian strides to his car--a garish red sports car. In moments he's peeled out of the vast parking lot.

Several rows down, Eve's Corolla pulls out of the parking lot as well, following Spandarian.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

Spandarian's sports car absolutely screams down the freeway, casually weaving. Eve's Corolla struggles to keep up. A thick layer of SMOKY HAZE blankets the city horizon.

INT. SPANDARIAN'S CAR - DAY

Spandarian blasts music, not paying attention to the car following him.

INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve grips the steering wheel, a little alarmed by all the weaving.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

Without a blinker, Spandarian takes an exit. Speeds off. Eve follows.

EXT. HILLY ROAD - DAY

Spandarian's car explodes down a curvy road. It passes a multitude of fancy, hillside mansions.

INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve turns wildly at times, trying to keep up on the hilly road.

EXT. HILLY ROAD - DAY

Spandarian's car climbs. Higher and higher, to the glittering top of LA real estate.

He blasts past a tree-filled gully, around a TIGHT TURN.

INT./EXT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve struggles to keep her eyes open. From her POV, the ROAD BLURS. 

She shakes her head. Comes around the corner--

Loses control--

Grips the wheel tightly, trying to steer back--

But the car goes OFF THE ROAD, and DOWN the gully--

A tire strikes a ROCK--

And it comes to a rest 30 feet down from the road.

INT. SPANDARIAN'S CAR - DAY

Spandarian hears the CRASH. It awakes him from his reverie. 

He checks his mirror. Slams on the brakes and comes to a stop.

INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

The air bag has detonated. Eve slumps over it, injured but alive.

She raises her head weakly. Looks around at the wrecked car.

EXT. SPANDARIAN'S CAR - DAY

Spandarian's car turns around and goes back down the road, toward the wreckage site.

INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve hears the car coming. She realizes she's in trouble: "He can't know I was following him." 

She immediately unbuckles and twists out of the car seat. She groans in pain--her right arm is hurt.

EXT. SPANDARIAN'S CAR - DAY

Spandarian's car approaches the curve.

INT./EXT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve opens the door as she hears the car come to a stop at the road above.

She climbs out.

EXT. SPANDARIAN'S CAR - DAY

Spandarian gets out of the car. Looks down at the wrecked car in the gully.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
Hello? Is anyone down there?

No answer.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
I'm a doctor. I can help!

Still nothing.

EXT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve hides behind a rock next to the car. She breathes heavily.

EXT. SPANDARIAN'S CAR - DAY

Spandarian starts slowly climbing down the slope, towards Eve's car.

EXT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve hears him coming down. She CRAWLS away from the car. As Spandarian approaches, she gets behind a tree, a good distance from the wreck.

Spandarian reaches her car. Checks inside. To his surprise, the car is empty. 

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
Jesus!

He checks out the cracked windshield. Looks around, trying to see if a body was thrown from the car. Nothing.

EXT. TREE - DAY

Eve listens intently.

EXT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Spandarian checks again. Finally he pulls out his phone. Dials 911.

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
911, what is your emergency?

SPANDARIAN
There's been a terrible accident. A car went off the road behind me and crashed into this gorge. I can't find the driver but I think he may have been thrown out of the car.

911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
And what is your location, sir?

SPANDARIAN
Stone Canyon Road. Just past Rocca.

EXT. TREE - DAY

Eve hears him talking. She limps away, taking care to not step on any leaves.

EXT. GULLY - DAY

Eve limps alongside a creek. She pulls her phone out and looks at her location on GPS. 

She stops by a small bridge, exhausted. Holds a beam for support and pants.

BEHIND HER, under the bridge, a HOMELESS WOMAN emerges from the shadows. She is dirty and hideous; matted hair and sticks poke out from her head.

HOMELESS WOMAN
So pretty.

Eve JUMPS, startled. 

The Homeless Woman moves towards her.

HOMELESS WOMAN (CONT'D)
Those shoes. Givenchy?

She stretches her hands towards Eve's shoes.

Eve shakes her head. Limps away as fast as she can.

HOMELESS WOMAN (CONT'D)
I just wanna talk!

Eve runs, wincing in pain. She heads down the gully.

EXT. HILLY ROAD - DAY

Eve emerges out of the gully onto a side road. She pulls out her phone.

From the gully she hears a blood-curdling SCREAM echo.

Eve runs again, phone in hand.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eve has been to the hospital. Her right arm is in a sling, and her nose is bandaged. 

She opens up the pantry and pulls out a teabag. She fills a kettle with water and puts it on the stove. Her PHONE rings.

EVE
Hello?

OFFICER TRENT (V.O.)
Los Angeles Police Department. Is this Eve Portugal?

EVE
Yes.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The cop on the other end of the line is OFFICER TRENT, 43, a laconic black female cop.

INTERCUT - PHONE CONVERSATION

OFFICER TRENT
Are you the owner of a 2014 Honda Civic, license 6YT913?

Eve realizes what's happening--and thinks fast.

EVE
Yes! Did you find it?

OFFICER TRENT
We found your car crashed in a ravine in Beverly Hills.

EVE
Oh my god! Someone stole it yesterday! How is the car?

OFFICER TRENT
It's totaled.

EVE
Shit. Did you catch the guy who did it?

OFFICER TRENT
No one was found at the scene. The suspect must have fled.

EVE
Of course.

OFFICER TRENT
Did you report the car as stolen yesterday?

EVE
No. I mean...well, I was going to. I've had bad experiences. I've had my car broken into before, and the cops haven't done anything.

The tea kettle WHISTLES.

OFFICER TRENT
I see. Well, if you come down to the station, you can sign some paperwork and we can take you to the garage where we impounded it. You'll want pictures for insurance.

Eve looks down at her appearance--she can't show up, or it would be obvious that she was in the car when it crashed.

EVE
Well, yes, I'll get around to it. I'll show up when I can.

OFFICER TRENT
Really? 

EVE
I have a busy schedule. 

OFFICER TRENT
Well, the car is at the garage on West Washington Boulevard. You have to come by the West LA station first.

EVE
I will. Thank you.

Officer Trent hangs up. She chuckles--another weirdo.

INT. JOAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Eve trudges in. Joan glances up, shocked.

JOAN
Jesus! What happened to you?

EVE
I got in a car accident.

JOAN
Looks pretty bad.

EVE
Broken nose. Broken arm. Lucky it wasn't worse. I went into a ravine.

JOAN
I'm so sorry.

She gets up from her desk and hugs Eve tightly. Eve winces.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Sorry. Shouldn't have touched you in this state.

EVE
It's the thought that counts. Anyways, you wanted to see me?

JOAN
Yes. I'm sure you've heard that Mia is back in town?

EVE
I saw her at a party at Keezer's place.

JOAN
What did she say?

EVE
Nothing. I hardly got the chance to talk to her.

JOAN
Did you talk to anyone?

EVE
I met a plastic surgeon, some influencers...they might be leads. I had to leave early. Delaney was feeling bad.

Joan sighs. It's a hard thing she has to say.

JOAN
I can't continue this story. So far it's a lot of smoke and not much fire. 

EVE
Something is going on! I saw some suspicious activity at Keezer's house. And I met with the photographer in downtown.

JOAN
And?

EVE
I think I was followed. He got spooked when he saw some people at the market, and we got separated. Then he just kinda disappeared on me.

JOAN
Disappeared?

EVE
Someone took care of him. They're tying up loose ends.

JOAN
If that's the case, then why is Mia back?

EVE
(despairing)
I don't know. I can't explain it.

Joan tries to be patient, like a parent talking with her child. 

JOAN
Eve, I know you wanted this story. But you're the only one still talking about Mia. She's safe and sound. And look at you, you're in no condition to investigate this. You definitely can't pose as an influencer with your face looking like that.

EVE
That agency is doing fucked-up shit to their models! You know it, and I know it. There is a cycle of abuse that goes all the way to the top. They might even be trafficking women.

JOAN
We're journalists. Not conspiracy theorists. I'm sorry, but I have to kill the story. 

EVE
Sometimes conspiracies are true.

JOAN
You're one of my top writers, Eve. And this has been consuming you. You need to relax, reset, and focus on healing up. Take the week off, if you need to. When you come back, you can start writing again.

Eve laughs bitterly.

EVE
I've still been writing. I have so many great, unfinished pieces. Maybe if I put them all together, I'd be halfway to my masterpiece.

JOAN
Why don't you finish them?

EVE
I'm afraid they'll grow up and leave me.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Eve enters gingerly. She hears RETCHING from the bathroom.

She steps gingerly up to it.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Delaney is sprawled over the toilet, PUKING.

EVE (CONT'D)
Jesus, Delaney!

Delaney stares back. Wipes her mouth. She's not sick--instead she's almost angry.

DELANEY
What?

EVE
Are you okay?

DELANEY
You can be so naive sometimes.

EVE
You don't need to do that.

DELANEY
I do.

She moves to close the door. Eve blocks her.

EVE
What the fuck is going on with you? You look terrible, you're snapping at me all the time. I don't remember you ever--

She motions with her finger in her mouth.

EVE (CONT'D)
Doing that before.

DELANEY
You don't look too good yourself.

Eve is shocked--sweet Delaney would never say something cruel to her.

EVE
You need to talk to me. Now.

Delaney storms out of the bathroom.

DELANEY
What, you're gonna fix me? Tell me I need to take a break? Or quit?

EVE
It's not a terrible idea.

DELANEY
Well, it looks like your influencer career is over. Doesn't mean mine has to be.

EVE
They're doing something to you, aren't they? Keezer, Fabian, all those Atelier guys? Alex said there was something at the photoshoots.

Delaney cannot bear to say what happened with Keezer--her pride is too strong.

DELANEY
Your big story is over. You can stop pretending to be one of us and go back to looking down on us like before.

EVE
I am trying to help here!

DELANEY
Of course. So helpful. So smart. You, gliding through the classes, helping me out after I flunked out of pre-med. You, telling me not to go into modeling, just like my parents.

EVE
You are like my sister. Hell, you are my sister. I want the best for me.

DELANEY
For me? I'm just another stupid airhead. Another dumb model you could observe like Jane Goodall with her chimps.

Eve is genuinely shocked and hurt at this.

EVE
I never said that. I never thought you were...like them!

DELANEY
I'm not like them, I'm not like them! But I'm one of them, right? So what's the difference, Eve? What's the fucking difference?

Eve is lost for words.

DELANEY (CONT'D)
I found a new place in Santa Monica. I'm moving out at the end of the month.

EVE
Delaney--

DELANEY
Don't act surprised. Sometimes I wonder how we even lasted this long anyway.

Delaney storms out. 

Eve stews. Then she heads to the fridge.

INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Eve is impulse shopping. She walks right past the produce stand. Down an aisle with junk food. She tosses a few boxes of cookies into a shopping cart.

She goes down another aisle. Tosses chips in. Then she catches herself. Pained, she starts to put them back.

Her phone buzzes. She checks it: a message from Chase.

Chase: Haven't seen u post in a while whats up??

Eve: got in a little accident lol. 

Chase: Oh shit what happened?

Eve: nothing just not looking too hot.

Chase: Nah you totally are I bet ;). 

Eve: Seriously tho.

Chase: Well you gotta come to the Viral House tomo. Big partay, everyone's gonna be there.

Eve considers this. She types out a message:

Eve: Idk I'm feeling pretty tired.

But she doesn't send it. She looks at the pile of cookies in her cart--a visible sign of her shame. She figures this is a better way to deal with it anyway. She deletes the message.

Eve: Sure? What's the addy?

EXT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The next morning. Eve strolls out of her apartment--to find that the SKY IS COMPLETELY ORANGE. 

She does a quick double-take before whipping out her phone. Articles pop up: "California wildfires: smoke turn Los Angeles skies orange." 

Her social media is abuzz: picture after picture of cute girls posing in the apocalyptic glow.

Eve sighs to herself. She's obligated to do it: she takes a selfie.

INT./EXT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve follows directions on her phone through a tony area of Los Angeles, as the radio blares.

RADIO (V.O.)
These wildfires have been bad, but no one expected the skies to turn orange this morning! All over LA County, the same story.

Eve turns down a curvy road. Her vision goes blurry. She blinks again: she is back at the SAME GULLY she crashed at while tailing Spandarian.

She wonders: am I going to the same house he was going to?

EXT. TIKTOK HOUSE - DAY

Eve pulls up to a massive hillside mansion.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Chase leads Eve through the palace. It is lavishly decorated--maximalist, even--spacious, and bright.

CHASE
Jesus Christ. How long do you think it'll take to recover? 

EVE
Couple of months to have full use of my arm. My nose might be crooked forever. 

CHASE
What do you mean? Dr. S can fix that nose right up.

EVE
Spandarian. Yeah. 

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

A WHITEBOARD displays the various House Rules, including "Wake up by 10 am SHARP", "House meetings at 11:30", "Try to save the drinking for Fri-Sun ;)", and in huge letters "Finish brand deliverables before inviting guests".

EVE (CONT'D)
How long have you been here?

CHASE
I've been at the Glass House for 3 months now. One day, I'm posting videos from my mom's place in Cincinnati, next thing I know 30,000 people are watching livestreams of me sleeping and they're flying me out here.

EVE
The American dream.

CHASE
We just gotta post like 3 or 4 videos a week for our brand partners and the Glass House account, and they put us up here.

EVE
How much is the rent?

CHASE
Dunno. Something crazy. 

Eve YELPS. She looks down to see a FERRET scurrying by her feet.

EVE
What the hell?

CHASE
They're cute! We got like 10 of them yesterday. Thought it would be a fun idea.

He points at another whiteboard covered with ideas for videos: "Bungee jump in tuxes", "Music vid on floating deck", and, crossed out, "Fun with ferrets!"

EXT. PATIO - DAY

CHASE
Isn't this great?

The view of downtown LA is great, if a little orange at the moment. They look out over a large pool, with a glass balcony surrounded by ravines.

At the other end of the pool, a group of six shirtless INFLUENCERS, all young men between 18 and 24, dance in unison underneath a ring light.

CHASE (CONT'D)
This orange light is just perfect. We're gonna make the dopest videos today. 

EVE
Shouldn't you be dancing too?

CHASE
Yeah, you wanna join?

EVE
I'm an Asian girl who posts literature content, and my arm is in a cast. What do you think?

CHASE
At least come meet the boys.

EVE
I guess I can do that.

CUT TO:

Eve chugs a red cup, in the middle of a furious game of Flip Cup. Chase is next to her.

CHASE
Go Eve, go go!

The other boys cheer. She FLIPS it successfully, before the boy in front of her.

Her team CHEERS. 

INFLUENCER #1
Champions!

INFLUENCER #2
You lost to a cripple chick, Bryce!

CHASE
Shut up bro, she whooped your ass.

Eve is very red. She can't help herself from grinning.

EVE
Me and my friends beat the Stanford lacrosse team at flip-cup one time. I got some skills, boys.

CHASE
With Delaney, right?

At the mention of her name, Eve's face darkens.

EVE
Yeah.

The other boys disperse into groups, talking and taking photos of the orange skyline.

Eve wanders over to the balcony. Chase follows her.

CHASE
Is something wrong?

EVE
No, nothing.

CHASE
Come on.

He puts his arm around her. She doesn't mind.

CHASE (CONT'D)
I'm all ears.

Eve chuckles. She is consciously being charmed.

EVE
I've just...things haven't been great with Delaney recently.

CHASE
You two are best friends, right?

EVE
She's like a sister to me. She's helped me a lot. In college and with family stuff.

CHASE
What kind of family stuff?

EVE
You really want to know?

CHASE
Yes.

EVE
You wanna hear about my family?

CHASE
Eve, I wanna know all about you. I'm listening. I'm here for you.

Eve isn't sure--but he is very cute, and she's a little drunk, and when was the last time she really talked to anyone besides Delaney? What the hell, right?

EVE
My Mom was raised in the Philippines. Catholic, of course. Then she met my dad while he was in the service, they got married, and she moved back with him to Modesto. Right before I was born she converted to Pentecostalism, and then she converted him.

CHASE
What's Pentecostalism?

EVE
It's...well...

She thinks about it, then decides: probably not worth explaining.

EVE (CONT'D)
It's Christian. Really Christian. But that's how they raised me and my sister. Now, life in Modesto is not exactly easy. 

CHASE
I think I drove through there once.

EVE
There's not a lot going on. But I did well in school and I ended up getting a scholarship to Stanford. My parents were so happy. My entire school was proud. I was the one that got out. The American Dream.

CHASE
That's where you met Delaney? Stanford?

EVE
Yeah. It was very different from Modesto. Not a lot of Christians there, for one. And everyone had summer houses and they all went skiing all the time and they had been to Europe.

CHASE
I have friends who went there.

EVE
I wanted to fit in. And I met a guy there. This really awesome guy. I fell in love with him. I lost my virginity to him. I wanted to move in with him. So I told my parents this.

Her voice falters.

EVE (CONT'D)
When my mom heard that I was going to move in with some guy...when she figured out I was having sex before marriage...

Beat.

EVE (CONT'D)
She called me a whore. I betrayed her, and I betrayed God.
And she didn't have a whore for a daughter. They disowned me. They said they would never speak to me again. My sister sided with them too.

She is quiet now. Chase is intrigued by her raw emotion.

EVE (CONT'D)
I took a lot of pills one night. I would have died if Delaney hadn't found me and taken me to the clinic. She kept me going that semester. I still haven't talked to my parents since then. Or my sister. But I've talked to Delaney every single day for 4 years--until yesterday.

She buries her face in her hands. Chase leans back--revealing his PHONE. He has been RECORDING the entire conversation.

EVE (CONT'D)
So that's why--

She notices the camera.

EVE (CONT'D)
What the fuck?

CHASE
Sorry but...I can't just let this go by. It's great content.

Eve glares. Then SNATCHES his phone and CHUCKS it over the balcony into the ravine below.

CHASE (CONT'D)
What the hell? Fabian gave me that!

He GRABS her purse in retaliation.

EVE
Get the fuck off!

He pulls out the phone and CHUCKS it into the ravine too.

CHASE
Now we're even!

Eve storms off.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - DAY

Eve navigates the bewildering maze of rooms, trying to escape. 

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - MANNEQUIN ROOM - DAY

She bursts into one room filled with MANNEQUINS.

She leans against the wall, breathing heavily. Everything is spinning--the alcohol, stress, or something else? She massages her temples, angry at herself for opening up.

She hears talking in the hallway. Then a familiar voice.

PRIYANKA (O.S.)
Shit. Shit. Shit.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

EVE
Priyanka?

The bathroom door is open. The light is not on.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Eve flicks the light on. Priyanka sits curled up by the toilet, BROKEN BOTTLE in hand, with one BLOODY WRIST slit open.

PRIYANKA
Shit.

EVE
What are you doing?

PRIYANKA
I don't wanna do it. I don't wanna go down there.

EVE
Go down where?

PRIYANKA
They said it's my turn. I hate it. I hate going down there.

EVE
What is down there?

Priyanka seems to register who she is talking to.

PRIYANKA
Can you go instead? Can you take my place?

Eve lifts Priyanka up.

EVE
We need to bandage this. I'm going to call an ambulance.

PRIYANKA
No!

EVE
You need to at least see a doctor.

PRIYANKA
They'll be so mad.

Eve places her hands on Priyanka's shoulders. Tries to get her to focus. Priyanka looks broken and worn out.

EVE
I need you to tell me what you mean. So I can help you.

Nothing. Priyanka can't make eye contact.

EVE (CONT'D)
Have you been sexually assaulted?

PRIYANKA
Behind the mannequins. There's a door.

EVE
Is that what's down there?

Priyanka just nods.

EVE (CONT'D)
I need to call someone.

PRIYANKA
No, don't! Just--just take my place.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - MANNEQUIN ROOM - DAY

Eve stalks back into the room. She goes from corner to corner, running her hands along the wall.

Finally in one corner she feels something. Moves a mannequin aside to find a SECRET DOOR.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - SECRET HALLWAY - DAY

LED lights give the hallway a medical glow. BLACK FOIL covers the walls, along with a rat's nest of cables and wires like an underground particle accelerator.

She pads along the subterranean hallway, not daring to breathe. She hears the pitter-patter of MICE.

She turns a corner--a light at the end, coming from a room.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - SECRET ROOM - DAY

In the center of the room: a STEEL BED next to a TRIPOD with no camera. Under the bed run messy cables, running up to walls covered in BLACK FOAM SPIKES. No electricity or sound may penetrate.

She hears a HUMMING sound. Spots another SLIDING GREEN DOOR.

She approaches it. Deep breath. She opens it slowly.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - MODEL ROOM - DAY

A circular room like a hospital ward. Beds filled with SLEEPING MODELS. 

Eve snaps more photos. Each girl is connected to an IV. Each IV machine has an old CRT TV on top of it: the TV plays footage of photoshoots for THAT MODEL. 

Eve walks around the perimeter, glancing at the models. They look exhausted. They shiver under blankets--blankets composed of fashion photos, pieced together like a ransom note.

Eve stops at one bed: it's DELANEY. 

Eve shakes her.

EVE
Delaney! Delaney!

Nothing. Eve rips the blanket off.

EVE (CONT'D)
Wake up now. Wake up!

Still nothing. Eve glances up at the IV: the TV is playing footage of DELANEY's FIRST ATELIER SHOOT.

Eve tries to turn the TV off, but none of the buttons work. 

Finally she grasps the IV and YANKS it out. A GREEN LIQUID gushes out of the tube.

Delaney gasps. She's awake.

EVE (CONT'D)
Delaney! Talk to me!

DELANEY
(groggy)
What?

Eve pulls Delaney out of the bed. She looks into Delaney's eyes: they're blank.

EVE
Delaney, you have to walk with me.

DELANEY
Who?

Eve doesn't have time for this. She wraps Delaney's arm around her shoulder and lifts her up.

As she turns into the center of the room to leave she looks up--

And sees a massive CAMERA RIG hanging from the ceiling like a chandelier. The rig is like the eye of a dragonfly, huge and circular, a mosaic built out of dozens of small cameras.

Eve realizes she's being watched.

EVE
We gotta go.

Eve supports Delaney as they stumble out--

When a HAND GRABS Eve's shoulder!

She jumps away--

To see that one of the MODELS has climbed out of bed. She is groggy, just like Delaney.

GROGGY MODEL
Help.

Eve considers the situation--and decides to go.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - SECRET ROOM - DAY

Eve carries Delaney past the bed and tripod. They loom menacingly. Eve picks up the pace.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - SECRET HALLWAY - DAY

EVE (CONT'D)
Delaney. Can you walk?

Eve lets Delaney go. She stands there like a baby deer, unsteadily supporting herself.

Eve leads her by the hand. She glances back, ever watchful for anybody following them.

INT. TIKTOK HOUSE - MANNEQUIN ROOM - DAY

They emerge from underground. Everything seems normal. But in the orange light Delaney looks terrible.

Eve glances around--but no one else is there. She pulls Delaney by the hand.

INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve speeds away, out of the neighborhood, breathing fast. Delaney leans against the window, looking passively out at the orange scenery.

DELANEY
I'm so tired.

EVE
We gotta go to the cops. Do you remember how you got down there?

DELANEY
No.

EVE
I just pulled you out of that house. Do you remember that? 

DELANEY
No. My head really hurts.

EVE
It must have been something in that IV drip. Some sort of drug to make you forget what they were doing to you.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Eve and Delaney sit in front of none other than Officer Trent, who scratches notes on some paper.

OFFICER TRENT
Do you suspect sexual assault?

EVE
Yes. All these girls were kept in a room underneath this house. What else could it be for?

OFFICER TRENT
This is a very serious allegation. Do you have any photos of this?

EVE
Well...no. I lost my phone. Someone there destroyed it.

Officer Trent sighs. 

OFFICER TRENT
I can send an officer to the house. But they can't search it without a warrant. They can just ask around, hope someone lets them in.

EVE
Right.

OFFICER TRENT
I'd also like to have a doctor examine you, Miss Gray. We need to collect physical evidence of sexual assault. Miss Gray?

Delaney is still out of it.

DELANEY
Yes?

OFFICER TRENT
Do you consent to a physical examination?

DELANEY
Like a rape kit?

Officer Trent shifts uncomfortably in her seat.

OFFICER TRENT
Yes.

DELANEY
No!

Eve is shocked.

EVE
Delaney, what are you doing?

DELANEY
I can tell. I wasn't assaulted.

OFFICER TRENT
Yet your friend here says you were.

EVE
I have a strong suspicion.

DELANEY
I just remember putting on my makeup and going to get brunch with some of my friends. We had a lot of bottomless mimosas. I think we went to someone's house, I'm not sure. But I'm pretty sure no one raped me.

Officer Trent checks a form on her desk.

OFFICER TRENT
Eve Portugal. That's your name?

EVE
Yes.

OFFICER TRENT
Did you call us about a stolen vehicle a few days ago?

Eve realizes she's been caught in a lie.

EVE
Yes. Yes I did.

Officer Trent scans Eve's broken nose and arm.

OFFICER TRENT
The car was totaled. You still haven't picked it up. And you told me you weren't in the vehicle when it crashed.

EVE
Listen, I know it looks bad--

OFFICER TRENT
I don't know if this is a prank, or some sort of con.

EVE
Have you heard of Atelier? 

OFFICER TRENT
The fashion brand?

EVE
Delaney here? She works for Atelier. I am a journalist. I am investigating Atelier for possible sex trafficking and routine sexual assault. I believe it goes all the way to the top.

Eve looks and sounds like a crazy conspiracy theorist.

OFFICER TRENT
Your friend claims she was just drinking heavily. There is no evidence to suggest--

EVE
There is evidence, there is tons of fucking evidence if you would just listen!

Officer Trent glares. This interview is over.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DELANEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Eve drinks a steaming cup of tea. She watches over Delaney, fast asleep in her bed. Both look haggard, especially Delaney.

Eve strokes Delaney's hair. Wonders what just happened.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DELANEY'S ROOM - DAY

The next morning. Eve is now dressed. She wakes Delaney.

EVE
Good morning sunshine.

Delaney stretches, still very groggy.

DELANEY
Good morning. 

EVE
I'm really sorry, but I have to go to work.

DELANEY
No, of course.

EVE
I wish I could stay.

DELANEY
You gotta work.

EVE
If you need anything...well, I don't have a phone, but email me. I'll be at my desk.

DELANEY
OK. I love you, Eve. I'm sorry if--

EVE
I love you too. Be back soon.

INT. THE PACIFIC OFFICE - DAY

Eve paces carefully through the office. Still on edge from yesterday. She avoids all eye contact, headed for Joan's office.

But from across the office Mandy spots her.

MANDY
Eve! There's someone here to see you.

EVE
I just got here.

MANDY
He was early.

EVE
Who?

MANDY
Check reception.

INT. THE PACIFIC OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY

Fabian rises from his seat to meet her.

FABIAN
Miss Portugal. So good to see you. Shall we take a walk?

EXT. THE PACIFIC OFFICE - DAY

They walk in the bright sunshine, Eve giving Fabian a wide berth.

FABIAN (CONT'D)
I am grieved by your accident. I had such bright hopes for your future with us at Engagify.

EVE
It's probably for the best.

FABIAN
I don't want our business relationship to end. I believe you have great potential. You were very successful cultivating a literate, cultured image. In fact, I hear you have an upcoming novel you hope to publish.

EVE
(suspicious)
Who told you that?

FABIAN
I have spoken with a dear friend of mine, a top executive at a New York publishing house. He has agreed to offer you an advance for your novel. $600,000 and a cut of book sales. 

EVE
Are you serious right now?

FABIAN
Not only that, but your brand will be a top priority with Engagify influencers. We will push your social media engagement through the roof. Your book will have unprecedented publicity for a first-time author. 

Eve chuckles at Fabian's audacity.

EVE
You're trying to buy me off?

FABIAN
(softly)
Our relationship need not be antagonistic. We can offer you the chance to live your dream--to flourish as a writer, to enter the upper crust of the literary world.

EVE
In exchange for keeping quiet? 

FABIAN
You will like me better as a friend.

EVE
I don't need new friends. I have Delaney.

FABIAN
You care about her deeply.

EVE
None of you freaks are going to touch her. 

FABIAN
If this concerns you, then she can be released from her contract with Decadence. No one need work with her again. Her career will be over, but she will be safe. Do you think she would like you doing this for her?

EVE
No. She would be upset. But only because she can't remember what you're doing to her.

Fabian smiles. Plays dumb, as usual.

FABIAN
How intriguing. Such wild accusations you toss out, all with no proof.

EVE
Convenient for you.

FABIAN
I hope you will not be so unreasonable as to toss aside a promising career on this flight of fancy.

EVE
Alex Bustamante disappearing was not a flight of fancy. Priyanka, Mia, Delaney--I know what you and Keezer are doing to them.

FABIAN
But you don't.

He draws closer to her.

FABIAN (CONT'D)
You have been having lapses in memory too, haven't you? Trouble sleeping. Brain fog. 

He's right--Eve realizes that somehow, some way, Fabian is responsible for this.

FABIAN (CONT'D)
How can you trust what you see? How can anyone else trust what you say? You are running headlong into a brick wall, my dear. I can save you from yourself.

EVE
Don't bother. I'm gonna keep going until you and all your friends are strung up by your ankles.

Fabian chuckles darkly. 

FABIAN
Worry about your own friends, Miss Portugal.

Off he goes.

Eve realizes what he means.

EXT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

Eve's car roars out of the parking lot.

INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY

The brain fog is back. But Eve HAS to keep driving.

EXT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eve pulls up to her apartment. Bounds up the stairs.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

No one is inside.

EVE
Delaney! Delaney!! Where are you?!

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DELANEY'S ROOM - DAY

The bed is neatly made. All empty.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eve collapses on the couch. Everything is SWIRLING. Her breath rattles like an old woman.

She runs water in the sink. She thrusts a cup under the faucet and gulps it down. Then splashes some water in her face. Her head is still POUNDING.

When she turns off the water, she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND. Faint, but unmistakable. 

It's coming from the PANTRY. Right next to the fridge.

Eve breathes heavily. Steps over to it. SLOWLY opens the cabinet.

There is NOTHING in the pantry. But still she hears that SOUND, louder now. Like a cardboard box being scraped.

She sees a BOX OF PASTA at the bottom of the pantry. She lifts up the box--

--and a MOUSE JUMPS OUT! It lands on the floor.

She yelps. The MOUSE scurries underneath the fridge.

Eve backs away. It's like the entire house is an enemy.

She takes a moment to collect herself, but she cannot. 

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Eve huddles with a blanket in Delaney's tub. She looks as bad as Delaney did before.

She glances up at the sink. Where once there were photos of other models, now the vanity is covered with PHOTOS of Delaney. A reminder of her missing friend.

INT. THE PACIFIC OFFICE - DAY

Eve stares at the computer. The blinking cursor. It fuzzes up before her eyes.

She slurps some coffee, in a vain attempt to stay awake. The cursor still just blinks.

MANDY
Eve!

Eve jerks out of her stupor. Mandy is right by her desk, smiling widely.

EVE
Hey.

MANDY
How you been? You've been looking a little tired recently.

EVE
Thanks. I really needed that reminder.

MANDY
No, I didn't mean it like that! I just was thinking you could really use a break. My friend works at a spa, and she's giving me a free facial on Sunday. You wanna come?

Eve studies Mandy. The smile, the invitation--something seems off.

EVE
I don't know.

MANDY
It would be so fun. Just us girls, having some time to treat ourselves. I feel like it would be nice for us to hang out outside of work.

Eve can sense it--something is definitely wrong.

EVE
I'm really busy this weekend. Thanks for the invite, but I don't think I can make it.

MANDY
Well, some other time then. Just let me know!

She smiles again. Flutters away.

Eve stares at her screen, now pretty unsettled.

INT. JOAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Eve knocks on Joan's door. Joan looks up from her computer.

JOAN
Yes, Eve?

EVE
Sorry, but I'm not feeling well today. I think I need to go home.

JOAN
I'm so sorry. You do look a bit sick.

EVE
Yeah. I think all the stress finally caught up to me.

JOAN
Okay. I know you really believed in that story. It's devastating when things don't work out.

EVE
Yeah, it is. Devastating.

JOAN
Take some time. I'll get someone else to cover your stories in the meantime.

EVE
Thank you so much.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eve trudges into the apartment--

to the sound of SQUEAKING. FRANTIC, HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING.

She is on edge again.

The sound is coming from the fridge. Eve cautiously pads over to it.

She finds a SNAP TRAP with a MOUSE caught in it just behind the fridge. The mouse is still alive, with half its body broken. It struggles ferociously to get free.

Eve can barely look at it. She doesn't know what to do--but the squeaking is SO LOUD. Piteous.

She grabs a CLEAVER from the kitchen. She pushes the fridge away, to give herself some room. 

The mouse SQUEAKS EVEN LOUDER. Eve raises the knife. She can't look at it.

Finally she SLASHES the mouse with the knife. The squeaking stops. Eve catches her breath.

She pulls a trash bag out from under the sink.

EXT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eve puts out the trash like it is radioactive waste.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Piles of delivery boxes stacked up on the kitchen table. Eve forces some Chinese food down her mouth. 

The DOOR OPENS. 

EVE (CONT'D)
Who is it?

She grabs the CLEAVER AGAIN--

But it is DELANEY. Or it seems to be.

NEW DELANEY
Eve!

The girl comes in and hugs Eve. Eve cannot believe what she's seeing.

EVE
Delaney! What happened to you? I thought they took you away.

NEW DELANEY
No, silly. I just went on a retreat.

Eve gets a good look at her. This girl looks like Delaney--but somehow different. Her skin is flawless. Her hair is blonder. Her Southern twang sounds off.

EVE
What do you mean, a retreat?

NEW DELANEY
Decadence had a wellness retreat for all the models up in Palm Springs. Meditation, massages, all that. I'm so sorry, I should have told you first.

EVE
I told you to stay home. I told you Decadence is not safe. 

This New Delaney giggles.

NEW DELANEY
Well, I don't know about that. This is my job, after all. I can't do it staying at home.

EVE
What happened to you, Delaney?

NEW DELANEY
What do you mean? I'm fine. I feel great.

Eve glares at her.

EVE
Who are you?

NEW DELANEY
I'm Delaney.

EVE
Do they think I'm a fucking idiot? Do they think I don't know my best friend?

NEW DELANEY
Eve, why are you talking like that? It's kinda scary. 

EVE
Who are you, some fucking blonde bimbo? Some--

Eve stops. Everything makes sense now.

EVE (CONT'D)
Mia. 

New Delaney fidgets nervously.

NEW DELANEY
You're being really weird.

EVE
Mia never came back. 

NEW DELANEY
I gotta go change.

Eve BLOCKS HER.

EVE
Maybe everyone else thinks you all look the same. But I know the difference. You're getting out of this apartment, whoever-you-are.

NEW DELANEY
Eve, stop.

EVE
Get the fuck out.

Eve grabs the cleaver again.

NEW DELANEY
Oh my god! Eve!

EVE
Now.

New Delaney backs away. She opens the door again, letting the setting sun shine on Eve.

NEW DELANEY
I'm gonna call the police if you keep acting like this. I'm worried about you. We'll talk.

The door shuts.

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Eve scrolls through Instagram on her old phone.

The most recent picture on Delaney's account was posted 4 hours ago from Palm Springs--it shows the New Delaney.

Eve scrolls down. The next picture before that was posted 3 days ago. This is the real Delaney. 

She poses in front of a featureless, white background. It looks similar to the set Eve saw in the basement.

Eve zooms in on the edges of the photo. Something else is visible near the white background: a damp, MOLDY WALL. 

Eve thinks on this. Then pulls up her Photo album. She goes back to the day of the party at Keezer's house. Pulls up a photo: a GREEN DOOR, a dazed model and a photographer, and behind them, a MOLDY WALL.

Eve opens her dresser up. She pulls out the OLD KEY that Priyanka gave her.

Everything clicks: she knows where Delaney is.

.MONTAGE -- EVE PREPARES.

--Eve pulls up a fake Instagram account under the name "Jade." She sends a DM to Andre Keezer's account: "Hi! I'm a model who just moved here from Tokyo. I am SUCH a huge fan of Atelier, and really admire what you've done with the company. I'd love to get a drink with you and learn more about the industry :)"

--Eve runs her hair under a faucet, next to a large bottle of HAIR DYE.

--A message from Keezer himself: "Certainly! I welcome the chance to mentor new talent. I'll be at the Sycamore in West Hollywood tonight, if you'd like to meet after my meeting."

--Eve lifts her head up from the sink. Studies her new blonde hair in the mirror. She peels off the bandage on her nose for a second: it still looks gross. She puts it back on.

--Eve responds: "That sounds pretty cool. But is it true you live in the Gottman House? I've seen pictures of it in architecture books and I would LOVE to see it personally."

--Eve dresses sexy. She laces up long, black boots--and slides a THIN KNIFE into each boot.

--Keezer responds: "Even better! Come by at midnight. Tell the doorman your name and he'll let you in."

--Eve packs a bottle of PILLS in her purse and the OLD KEY.

--Eve: "Awesome! SOOO excited to finally meet you!"

INT. EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Almost ready to go. But Eve stops before going to the door. She plops down on the couch and pulls out her phone.

Trembling slightly, she presses the contact: "Mom." Lifts it to her ear as it rings.

She hopes for a second. Wonders what she would say. 

But it rings. And rings. Until finally--

VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
You have reached the voicemail box of--Maria Portugal. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording--

Eve just hangs up. Deep pain shrouds her face--until she laughs bitterly at herself, for daring to believe things could be different, for daring to reach out for one last moment of connection.

She heads out the door.

EXT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

Eve's car pulls up to the gate.

Eve lowers her window and addresses a SECURITY GUARD.

EVE
It's Jade. Mr. Keezer is expecting me.

SECURITY GUARD
For sure. Come on through.

Eve rolls through the gate.

She stops by the door. Gets a message from Keezer: "Front door is open. I'm in the parlor." So she goes through the door.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

Back in the concrete maze. Eve pads through it cautiously. But she breathes, knowing she has to appear cool.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - PARLOR - NIGHT

Keezer sits at a table, poring over a portfolio of photos.

Eve speaks in her high-pitched bimbo voice.

EVE
Mr. Keezer?

KEEZER
Jade!

EVE
(giggles)
Yes, that's me.

KEEZER
What the hell happened to your face?

EVE
I was just in an accident. Sad thing. But my doctor says he can make my nose better than ever.

Keezer shakes her hand, grabbing her shoulder with his massive paws as he does so.

KEEZER
That's more like it. I know a guy.

EVE
Thank you for agreeing to meet me. This is such an honor.

KEEZER
Couldn't leave a little lady like you out in the cold. You just got to LA?

EVE
Yes. I was in Tokyo, under contract with Hashimoto.

KEEZER
(snorts)
I see why you decided to come here.

EVE
I had a great experience, but I just knew it was time for bigger and better things.

KEEZER
Sure. Let's get you a drink.

EVE
Yes, yes.

Keezer returns in a moment with a bottle of red wine.

KEEZER
Chateau La-fit. Good shit right here.

He pours them each a slug into two crystal glasses.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Cheers to new friends!

EVE
Kanpei!

KEEZER
Oh yeah, kanpei!

Clink.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
You look mixed.

EVE
My father is Japanese. My mother is from Modesto.

KEEZER
Well well, look how far you've come! Your parents sure made something special, I'll say that.

Eve giggles. Then gestures to the walls.

EVE
I love this house! So unique.

Keezer turns around to wax poetic about the house.

KEEZER
Yup. I bought this pile of concrete back when Atelier went public. Was in a shitty state back then. But I fixed her up.

With his back turned, Eve DROPS A PILL into Keezer's drink.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Built to withstand earthquakes, floods, and fires. The original owner believed Los Angeles would sink into the ocean one day, but he might survive it in this.

EVE
Wow, that's so interesting!

Keezer gulps down his drink.

EVE (CONT'D)
I would love a tour of the house. You seem to know so much about it.

Keezer is loving this.

KEEZER
Of course, sweetheart. I can show it all to you.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Keezer leads Eve unsteadily to a room.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
There's a great piece in here.

INT. PRIVATE BEDROOM - NIGHT

The SAME BEDROOM where Keezer assaulted Delaney.

Keezer gestures towards the painting on the wall. He slurs his words.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Got this after World War II. From some Nazi owners or something.

EVE
It's beautiful.

Keezer stares at her suspiciously, eyes watery.

KEEZER
You must be the shortest model I ever seen.

EVE
I'm tall in Japan.

This satisfies him--just as the inebriation really kicks in.

KEEZER
Listen, I gotta take a leak. That French shit is strong, god damn.

He stumbles to the bathroom. 

The instant the door locks, Eve drops the act.

She puts her ear to the door. From inside she hears Keezer fumbling for the sink, the water turning on--

-And Keezer FALLING to the ground. His breathing sounds like SNORING.

Eve quickly grabs a chair and WEDGES it against the door handle, trapping Keezer inside the bathroom. She steps quietly out of the room.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

Eve tiptoes through the house, trying to remember where she went. The concrete walls seem to close in on her. Every hallway looks the same.

Eve continues, slowly opening doors and peering down. Nothing.

Until finally--

She spots the SLIDING GREEN COPPER DOOR.

Eve gazes at the OLD KEY in her hand. Is this it?

She slides it into the keyhole. The door SWINGS OPEN.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - SECRET PASSAGE - NIGHT

A moldy hallway. A flickering light dangles overhead. Eve closes the door behind her. Removes a knife from one of her boots and turns on her phone flashlight.

She steps down the stairs slowly, brandishing the KNIFE and LIGHT ahead of her.

The muffled sound of SOMEONE HUMMING filters down the hall.

Eve approaches a lit doorway.

INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

She peers in. Sees Dr. Spandarian dressed in scrubs HUMMING absentmindedly as he busies himself.

Behind him is a bed. A SHRUNKEN, WRINKLY MODEL sleeps, connected to an IV drip of green liquid.

Spandarian hears something, but doesn't turn his back.

SPANDARIAN
Andre, I doubled the dose, but this one has probably three sessions left. We should probably start soon before vitals start dropping.

No answer. Eve tries to hide. Spandarian turns around.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
Andre? You done with that girl up there?

He steps out to the door. Eve readies herself.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
I swear, you are just a dog sometimes--

As he steps out--

Eve PINS HIM TO THE WALL, pressing the KNIFE up to his NECK.

EVE
Don't make a fucking sound.

Spandarian's eyes flicker down to the knife, then to Eve's face.

SPANDARIAN
That face...I know you.

EVE
Shut up. Is there anyone else here?

SPANDARIAN
No. Just Keezer. Upstairs.

EVE
Is Delaney here?

SPANDARIAN
Yes. Of course.

Eve presses the knife deeper into his neck.

EVE
Show me!

SPANDARIAN
Easy now. I'll show you.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - SECRET PASSAGE - NIGHT

Under the flickering light. Spandarian leads Eve, the knife still against his neck.

EVE
What is that green stuff?

SPANDARIAN
A medicine of my own invention.

They approach a METAL-BRACED DOOR.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
Delaney is in here.

EVE
Open it.

INT. SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

The door creaks as it swings open.

The room is a black, concrete tomb--completely dark except for a STAGE on the opposite wall, illuminated by TALL LIGHTS.

The stage is set up like a stereotypical American house, with a white picket fence and fake grass.

EVE (CONT'D)
Where is she--

From the darkness a HAND GRABS Eve. It YANKS away the knife. Another man PULLS EVE off Spandarian.

Eve struggles, but she is no match for the two burly men.

Keezer emerges from a corner--unsteady, but upright.

KEEZER
You stupid bitch. You think I'm some 100-pound college girl? Takes more than what you had to put me out.

Spandarian massages his neck.

SPANDARIAN
I've seen this girl. Met her at your party.

KEEZER
Delaney Gray's friend. I didn't recognize her at first. But now I remember what Fabian told me. We didn't move fast enough to clean her up.

EVE
Where is Delaney?

Keezer laughs at her.

KEEZER
She's here! You were right about that. You're just in time, actually. You can watch the show. Watch her become a real star.

SPANDARIAN
Come on, Andre. That's a little cruel, don't you think?

KEEZER
Oh, it's all cruel.

.SERIES OF SHOTS.

--The two men tie Eve to a pipe in the corner of the room with rope.

--They pull up a huge CAMERA: sleek, futuristic, and MATTE-GREEN.

--Keezer barks out orders as the men set up a photoshoot.

--Two photographers prepare smaller, matte-green CAMERAS.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
I think we're ready for the talent. Delaney!

A door opens. Spandarian emerges. 

By the arm he leads the REAL DELANEY. She seems to have aged 100 years: wizened, hideous, wrinkled, with tufts of missing hair and cloudy eyes. She resembles the Homeless Woman Eve saw.

She wears a fashionable outfit, including a crop top exposing her wrinkly belly.

EVE
What did you do to her?

KEEZER
We made her a star. She was a girl before--a messy thing. Now, when people look at her pictures, she's perfect.

SPANDARIAN
The camera is something I invented. It takes that beauty that every model has and harnesses it, reproduces it. We give it to the audience.

KEEZER
Atelier is the next stage in the evolution of media. Consumers can feel the power of our photos. It draws them in, with all the vitality of a living woman. No one else can compete.

EVE
Your cameras are doing that to her? To all your models?

KEEZER
They do it to themselves.

SPANDARIAN
See, that was Andre's idea. We were popular before, when we had to take the pictures here. But putting the cameras in their phones, and letting them harvest themselves for sale--a stroke of brilliance!

EVE
It's in the phones?

KEEZER
You were doing it too. You posted just as much as they did. Day by day, giving yourself up to us. Spreading it on the Internet for everyone to see.

SPANDARIAN
It is more sustainable for the models to harvest themselves, so to speak. But eventually the process takes a toll. We have to bring them in for rejuvenation. Hence the green liquid you saw. It keeps them going for longer.

Keezer puts a hand on Delaney, who just drools, unaware of where she is.

KEEZER
But this one? She's at the end of her rope.

SPANDARIAN
We had to bring her in. The effects cannot be ignored when they approach the end of the process. Then the more intense stage begins. We have to keep them here for that until the end.

KEEZER
But there is always someone else who will take their place.

EVE
Mia. And that girl you called Delaney.

KEEZER
She is Delaney now! No one out there will know the difference. She's just as beautiful.

SPANDARIAN
Some of these girls have these rough edges when they start out, these little unusual things that make them hard to swallow, visually speaking. And this wonderful device we have, this camera, is like a file.

He jumps behind the camera. Swivels it at Eve.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
It sands them down, makes them soft and pliable. We sand them down until they fit nicely on your phone screen.

EVE
Do you really think no one is going to notice all these missing girls?

KEEZER
They won't! They're all the same. Especially when you just look at them through a screen.

SPANDARIAN
Mia was a scary case for us. She almost cost us the whole operation. But we found a suitable replacement eventually.

KEEZER
And now we've got another Delaney. The show goes on.

Spandarian notices Delaney stooping down.

SPANDARIAN
Andre, we'd better get rolling on the shoot. 

Keezer pushes Delaney into the center of the shoot.

KEEZER
You still got something left, dear? One more job?

Delaney stares, dumbfounded.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Nod yes.

Delaney nods slowly, still drooling.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
She's ready. Let's go!

Keezer steps away, leading the wizened Delaney alone under the lights.

One of the PHOTOGRAPHERS turns on the camera. On the display we see the shoot, but with one difference.

On the display, Delaney looks IMPOSSIBLY GORGEOUS. A vision of the old Delaney, but MORE PERFECT than ever before. 

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Bend over, Delaney! Bend over!

Delaney complies. The two scenes are side-by-side: a hideous crone in reality, the camera monitor displaying a beautiful woman on the screen.

The Photographers drool over the Venus on their screens, ignoring the real person before them.

Eve can only watch. Her eyes fill with tears.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Good! Now pout! Give me sex!

The camera lights FLASH. Delaney keeps posing, the Photographers twist around, grabbing photos of her.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Innocent! School girl!

More FLASHES! Delaney is dazed now.

SPANDARIAN
You're pushing it, Andre!

KEEZER
Keep going till it's dry!

FLASHES. The SHUTTERING of cameras. The screen display looks MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER. 

Eve squirms. She yanks her hands down the pipe, towards her boots.

Delaney stops. She teeters, like a swaying tree. Her eyes are completely cloudy now. There is barely any life left in her.

Her mouth FOAMS UP with GREEN BUBBLES.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Harder! Make it count!

Eve pulls the SECOND KNIFE out of her boot. She starts sawing at the ROPE tying her to the pipe.

Delaney TRIPS over the fence. Falls flat on her FACE.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Hold!

He steps over onto the set. He picks her up roughly. Then drops her. Delaney is DEAD.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
That's a wrap!

Eve CUTS her arm as she saws.

EVE
Ow!

Spandarian hears this. He walks over to the corner by Eve.

Eve pulls ONE HAND out from the rope.

SPANDARIAN
I know it's tough, honey. But this is content, real content.

He puts his hand on her shoulder--

--As she STABS HIM IN THE GUT!

Spandarian shrieks and stumbles backward, clutching his belly.

SPANDARIAN (CONT'D)
How dare you!

.AT THE SET.

Keezer glances up.

KEEZER
What the fuck is going on over there!?

Spandarian squirms on the ground.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
(laughing)
What, she kick you in the balls?

Eve frantically saws at the rope, trying to free her other hand.

Keezer undoes his belt. Slides it out from his pants as he strides over to Eve.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
You've been a bad girl. 

Eve GETS HER OTHER HAND FREE.

Keezer draws close. He SMACKS the belt against the ground.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
Papa's gotta teach you a lesson.

He RAISES THE BELT--

--And the knife strikes upward, SLASHING OPEN HIS FACE!

Keezer keels backward, holding his face.

He shrieks like a wounded animal. Barely able to see, he PUNCHES HER ARM. 

KEEZER (CONT'D)
You fucking ugly cunt!

The knife clatters to the ground.

Eve runs for the set--

But Keezer TACKLES her. She KNOCKS over a LIGHT.

The Photographers look on in horror as Keezer wrestles Eve to the ground. He is SO MUCH bigger than her.

The broken light IGNITES the fake grass. Flames start to crackle.

Eve struggles to breathe with his huge weight pressing down. His face, sliced open, drips blood onto her.

Keezer PRESSES HIS PALM into her broken nose. Eve cries out in pain.

KEEZER (CONT'D)
I'll kill you, you fucking cunt!

He grabs her neck. Starts SQUEEZING.

Eve's hands search for the knife.

Keezer keeps squeezing, his eyes full of hate.

Eve FINDS the KNIFE. And with all her strength, PLUNGES it into Keezer's NECK.

Keezer loosens his grip. Collapses. Eve can barely push him off her.

The flames jump around the set, climbing and climbing.

The Photographers just stare like frightened deer as Eve emerges from under Keezer. None of them move.

EVE
Get out of here!

They didn't sign up for this. They drop the cameras and run.

Eve finds Delaney's body and cradles it. But it doesn't even resemble Delaney anymore--just a dry husk. Eve tries to see what is left of her best friend.

EVE (CONT'D)
If you ever needed my life, you should have taken it.

Smoke curls around her. A FIRE ALARM starts to sound, deafening in the concrete chamber.

Eve stumbles away as the set burns behind her.

INT. KEEZER'S MANSION - SECRET PASSAGE - NIGHT

Eve struggles up the stairs, the fire alarm POUNDING overhead.

EXT. KEEZER'S MANSION - NIGHT

Eve bursts out of the house into the night air. The fire alarm continues to blare. Smoke leaks out of windows, but the fire, far below in the house's bowels, is not visible.

Eve limps to her car. Battered and almost broken, she crawls inside the refuge.

EXT. HILLY ROAD - NIGHT

Eve unsteadily steers past hillside estates.

A FIRE TRUCK speeds past her, going the other way.

EXT. JOAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Eve pulls up to a stately, Tudor-style mansion.

She POUNDS on the front door.

After a moment Joan answers. Although it's the middle of the night, she wears normal clothes. She regards Eve with horror.

JOAN
Eve? What the hell happened?

INT. JOAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Joan leads Eve into the foyer.

EVE
I'm sorry to wake you up--

JOAN
I was already up.

EVE
I just didn't know where else to go. I can't go to the police.

JOAN
What happened?

EVE
Andre Keezer. He tried to kill me. They killed Delaney.

JOAN
What?

EVE
They killed Mia too. It sounds crazy, but they do it to all the models. They have this room--these cameras--

JOAN
Eve, you need help. Look at yourself.

EVE
It's worse than I thought. Way worse. I wish I could have gotten pictures for the story, but there's proof at Keezer's house. They'll find it.

JOAN
The story? Eve, we can't write that story.

INT. JOAN'S HOUSE - PARLOR - NIGHT

Joan opens the door to the parlor to reveal--

FABIAN STANDING before them!

FABIAN
Good evening.

EVE
No...

She's too weak to move.

Joan steers her into an armchair. Eve doesn't resist.

JOAN
A story on Atelier would be a conflict of interest. The Pacific is majority owned by Blackburn Holdings, one of the original funders of Atelier and the largest single investor in Decadence.

FABIAN
You are a good journalist, Miss Portugal, but not thorough enough to look at your own employer.

JOAN
My hands are tied. I really wanted you to stop with this story. Fabian was ready to help you. 

FABIAN
In a way, you have helped me. Andre was a visionary. But he was messy. His proclivities threatened the business.

Fabian lights a cigarette. 

FABIAN (CONT'D)
He could build an empire, but not govern it. With him gone, we will be more secure than ever.

Eve is virtually catatonic. 

JOAN
She is one of my top writers.

FABIAN
I know. It is unfortunate. But our research scientists have been working on a new process that can salvage this.

JOAN
Eve is not meant for the Process.

FABIAN
No, she's not. She is a wonderful source of content, but it must be literary, not visual. This is what the new process provides.

Two HENCHMEN take Eve by the arms. Again, she doesn't resist. Eve just stares at Joan.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Eve is LOCKED into a MACHINE with shackles. Her eyes keep staring out, accusingly, at Joan.

Joan turns away. She stands in a brightly lit WAREHOUSE. In the center, Eve lies on her back on a flat metal bed, like she is being loaded into an MRI. 

But near her legs are HUGE ROLLERS, part of a MASSIVE MACHINE. Fabian stands near a control panel.

FABIAN (CONT'D)
Just as we captured the essence of a model and reproduced it in photographs, here we capture the soul of the writer and create beautiful words. 

Joan walks around the machine. At the other end is a pile of pages. The entire thing is a PRINTING PRESS.

Eve will be fed into it. The rollers gape open like the maw of a monster.

FABIAN (CONT'D)
Words more beautiful than even she could have ever produced.

Joan seems a bit regretful. Uncomfortable to see how the sausage is made.

JOAN
And this will make good content?

FABIAN
The product is only as good as the raw material. But Eve has great potential.

Joan gazes down at Eve. Eve's face doesn't betray a hint of fear.

Joan turns away. She starts to leave--

EVE
We're all the same, in the end. Just scared little kids, holding onto our mothers. Always asking her the same thing: 'I don't know what's going to happen. Am I going to be okay?'

Joan pauses. She leans down--and KISSES Eve on the cheek. 

Then she walks away from the machine. Fabian and his henchmen spring into action.

Joan keeps walking. Not looking back. Behind her the machine WHIRS to life. Joan stares ahead.

PRESENTER (PRE-LAP)
And now, to accept this award, please welcome the editor of The Pacific magazine, an inspiration to women everywhere, Joan Burgess.

INT. AWARDS SHOW - NIGHT

Joan, in a sparkly cocktail dress, picks her way through a tuxedo-clad crowd on her way to an award stage.

A screen projects the award: "Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing."

Joan smiles, hugs the PRESENTER, and holds up the PRIZE for all to see. The crowd CHEERS and CLAPS.

JOAN
Thank you so much for this honor. Every editor dreams of recognition for outstanding work. But I'd like to talk about the true recipient of this award.

Eve's face is projected behind her.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Eve Portugal was a singular talent who provided us with a moving meditation on the meaning of beauty, identity, and the struggle of the modern woman. It is a tragedy that an accident took her life before the world could appreciate her work.

Joan pauses. The mood is somber, respectful.

JOAN (CONT'D)
She was taken before her time, but her writing will live on forever. It is my privilege, as the first female editor of this magazine, to accept this award in her place. Let this night demonstrate the growing power of women. Let us show that a woman can do anything a man can.

The audience JUMPS to their feet, showering Joan with a STANDING OVATION. 

Joan poses with the award. She smiles in front of the portrait of Eve. 

Camera flashes illuminate her. Flashing BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER.

.FADE TO WHITE.
